Given a finite set of integers `A` (modelled as a `Finset ℤ`), the set
`CommonDifferencesThreeTermAP A` consists of all integers `d` such that there
is a non-trivial three-term arithmetic progression `a, b, c ∈ A` with
`b - a = d` and `c - b = d`.
-/
def CommonDifferencesThreeTermAP (A : Finset ℤ) : Set ℤ :=
  {d : ℤ | d ≠ 0 ∧ ∃ a ∈ A, ∃ b ∈ A, ∃ c ∈ A, b - a = d ∧ c - b = d}

/--
The main conjecture: for any finite set of integers $A$ with $|A| = n$, the number of distinct
common differences in three-term arithmetic progressions is $O(n^{3/2})$.

This conjecture was resolved negatively by showing that the problem is exactly equivalent to
Bourgain's sums-differences question [Bo99], which was introduced as an arithmetic path towards
the Kakeya conjecture. Under this equivalence:
- The greatest achievable exponent for this problem is equal to the smallest constant $c$
  achievable for Bourgain's sums-differences question:
  $$|A -_G B| \ll \max(|A|, |B|, |A +_G B|)^c$$
- The $O(n^{3/2})$ prediction is disproved because the lower bound has been shown to satisfy
  $c \ge 1.77898$ (due to Zheng and AlphaEvolve [GGTW25], improving on Lemm [Le15]), which is
  strictly greater than $3/2 = 1.5$.
- The best known upper bound is $c \le 11/6 \approx 1.833$ (due to Katz and Tao [KaTa99]).
- While the specific $O(n^{3/2})$ prediction is resolved negatively, the general question of
  determining the exact optimal exponent $c$ remains open.

A weaker bound has been proven: there are always at most $n^2$ such values of $d$.

A trivial lower bound: for sufficiently large `n` there exist sets $A$ with $|A| = n$ that contain at least $\Omega(n)$
distinct common differences of three-term arithmetic progressions.
