# Erdős Problem 70

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/70](https://www.erdosproblems.com/70)

The 3-uniform (triple) partition relation $\mathfrak{c} \to (\beta, n)^3_2$
on the ordinal of the real numbers — the triple analogue of `OrdinalCardinalRamsey`
used in Problems 590–592.

/- ### The 3-uniform partition relation -/

/--
`OrdinalCardinalRamsey3 α β c` asserts the 3-uniform ordinal Ramsey property
$\alpha \to (\beta, c)^3_2$.

It states that for any 2-coloring of all 3-element subsets of (the ordinal type) $\alpha$,
one of the following must hold:
* There is a red-monochromatic subset of order type $\beta$: every 3-element sub-subset is
  colored red. (Formally: a set $s \subseteq \alpha$ with $\operatorname{typeLT} s = \beta$
  such that any three distinct elements of $s$ are colored red.)
* There is a blue-monochromatic subset of cardinality $c$: a set $s \subseteq \alpha$ with
  $\#s = c$ such that every three distinct elements of $s$ are colored blue.

The coloring is given as a predicate `isRed : α.ToType → α.ToType → α.ToType → Prop` on
ordered triples of distinct elements; to faithfully encode a coloring of *unordered*
3-element subsets we additionally require `isRed` to be invariant under permutation of
its three (distinct) arguments.

/- ### The main open problem -/

/--
**Erdős Problem 70**: Let $\mathfrak{c}$ be the cardinality of the continuum,
let $\beta$ be a countable ordinal, and let $2 \le n < \omega$.
Is it true that $\mathfrak{c} \to (\beta, n)^3_2$?

Note: The cases $n \le 3$ are trivially true (see `omega_three`), so the
genuine content of the conjecture begins at $n = 4$.

**Erdős–Rado partial result**: $\mathfrak{c} \to (\omega + n, 4)^3_2$ for any
$2 \le n < \omega$. Positive partial answer to Problem 70 with $\beta = \omega + n$
and the blue side fixed at $4$.

/--
**First open case beyond Erdős–Rado**: $\mathfrak{c} \to (\omega \cdot 2, 4)^3_2$.

Erdős and Rado proved $\mathfrak{c} \to (\omega + n, 4)^3_2$ for every finite $n \ge 2$
(see `erdos_rado`), which covers all red ordinals below $\omega \cdot 2 = \omega + \omega$.
This variant asks whether the result extends to $\beta = \omega \cdot 2$, the simplest
countable ordinal not covered by their theorem.

    answer(sorry) ↔ OrdinalCardinalRamsey3 (𝔠).ord (ω * 2) 4 := by
  sorry

/--
**Trivial boundary case**: $\mathfrak{c} \to (\omega, 3)^3_2$.

This is trivially true because in a 3-uniform hypergraph, a \"blue clique of size 3\"
consists of a single 3-element subset ($\binom{3}{3} = 1$), so the blue alternative
merely asks for one blue triple to exist. The proof splits into two cases:
- If any blue triple exists, it is itself a blue-monochromatic set of cardinality 3.
- If no blue triple exists, all triples are red, and since $\omega \le \mathfrak{c}$,
  any subset of order type $\omega$ is red-monochromatic.

The problem becomes non-trivial only for $n \ge 4$; see `omega_times_two_four` for
the simplest genuinely open case.

**The relation at $\omega_1$**: $\mathfrak{c} \to (\omega_1, n)^3_2$ for finite $n \ge 2$,
where $\omega_1 = \aleph_1$ is the first uncountable ordinal.

Note that $\omega_1$ is *not* a countable ordinal, so this is not directly an instance of the
main Erdős problem (which asks for *countable* $\beta$). Under CH, $\omega_1 = \mathfrak{c}.\mathrm{ord}$,
making this a self-referential question about $\mathfrak{c}.\mathrm{ord} \to
(\mathfrak{c}.\mathrm{ord}, n)^3_2$.

**Monotonicity of `OrdinalCardinalRamsey3`**:
If `OrdinalCardinalRamsey3 α β c` holds and $\beta' \le \beta$, $c' \le c$, then
`OrdinalCardinalRamsey3 α β' c'` also holds.

This allows us to deduce weaker partition results from stronger ones.
