From [FSS20]: given $A \subseteq G \times G$ and $d \in G$, let
$$S_d(A) = \lbrace (x, y) \in G \times G : (x, y), (x + d, y), (x, y + d) \in A \rbrace$$

/--
What is $C$, the infimum of all exponents $c$ for which the following is true, uniformly for
$0 < \alpha < 1$? Suppose that $A \subset \mathbb{F}_2^n \times \mathbb{F}_2^n$ is a set of density
$\alpha$. Write $N := 2^n$. Then there is some $d \neq 0$ such that $A$ contains $\gg \alpha^c N^2$
corners $(x,y), (x,y+d), (x+d,y)$.

This question has been resolved by [FSS20], showing that $C = 4$.

/- TODO(jeangud): in [FSS20] they mention that the corresponding question for squares
$(x, y), (x, y + d), (x + d, y), (x + d, y + d)$ is wide open (and here it is not even clear that
$C$ exists). -/
