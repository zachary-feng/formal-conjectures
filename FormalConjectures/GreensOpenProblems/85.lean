Suppose that $A$ is an open subset of $[0, 1]^2$ with measure $\alpha$. Are there four points in
$A$ determining an axis-parallel rectangle with area $\gt c \alpha^2$?

From [Gr24] "It is quite easy to show using Cauchy-Schwarz that there must be such a rectangle with
area $\gg \alpha^2 (\log 1/\alpha)^{-1}$."
