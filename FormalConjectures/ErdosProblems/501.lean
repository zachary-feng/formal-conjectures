/- ## Setup

For every `x : ℝ` we are given a set `A x ⊆ ℝ`. We say that `X ⊆ ℝ` is an
**independent set** for the family `A` if `x ∉ A y` for all distinct `x y ∈ X`.
This is exactly `X.Pairwise (fun x y => x ∉ A y)`; we inline this rather than
introducing a custom predicate so that all `Set.Pairwise` lemmas apply.

The problem concerns outer measure `< 1` on ℝ. For a set `s : Set ℝ` we use
`(MeasureTheory.volume.toOuterMeasure) s`, which equals the Lebesgue outer measure
of `s` (defined for all sets, whether measurable or not). The condition `< 1` is
stated in `ℝ≥0∞` (extended non-negative reals). -/

/- ## Main open problem -/

/--
For every $x \in \mathbb{R}$ let $A_x \subset \mathbb{R}$ be a bounded set with outer measure
$< 1$. Must there exist an infinite independent set, that is, some infinite $X \subseteq
\mathbb{R}$ such that $x \notin A_y$ for all $x \neq y \in X$?

If the sets $A_x$ are closed and have measure $< 1$, then must there exist an independent set
of size $3$?

Known results: Erdős–Hajnal [ErHa60] proved the existence of arbitrarily large finite
independent sets. Hechler [He72] showed the answer is **no** assuming the continuum
hypothesis. -/

/- ## Variants and partial results -/

/--
**Erdős–Hajnal (1960): arbitrarily large finite independent sets exist.**

For every `n : ℕ` and every family `A : ℝ → Set ℝ` of bounded sets with Lebesgue
outer measure `< 1`, there exists a finite independent set of size at least `n`.

This was proved by Erdős and Hajnal [ErHa60]. -/

/--
**Hechler (1972) [He72]: the answer to the main question is NO, assuming the continuum
hypothesis.**

Assuming CH (`ℵ₁ = 𝔠`), there exists a family `A : ℝ → Set ℝ` of bounded sets with
Lebesgue outer measure `< 1` for which no infinite independent set exists. -/

/--
**Closed sets case: existence of an independent set of size 3.**

If the sets `A x` are closed with Lebesgue measure `< 1`, must there exist an
independent set of size 3?

This is implied by the stronger theorem of Newelski–Pawlikowski–Seredyński [NPS87] below;
Gladysz [Gl62] earlier proved the existence of an independent set of size 2. -/

/--
**Newelski–Pawlikowski–Seredyński (1987) [NPS87]: infinite independent set in the closed case.**

If all the sets `A x` are closed with Lebesgue measure `< 1`, then there **is** an
infinite independent set. This gives a strong affirmative answer to the second
question of Problem 501. -/

**Gladysz (1962) [Gl62]: independent set of size 2 in the closed case.**

If all the sets `A x` are closed with Lebesgue measure `< 1`, then there exist two
distinct reals `x y` such that `x ∉ A y` and `y ∉ A x`.

This is a weaker result proved by Gladysz before the full Newelski–Pawlikowski–
Seredyński theorem [NPS87]. -/

For any family `A`, any singleton `{x}` is vacuously independent: there are no two
distinct elements. -/

**Two-element sets: independent iff mutual non-membership.**

A two-element set `{x, y}` (with `x ≠ y`) is independent for `A` if and only if
`x ∉ A y` and `y ∉ A x`. -/

/- ## Sanity checks and examples

The following `example` declarations exercise the proved variants and demonstrate that
the hypotheses of the main theorem are non-vacuous. All goals are fully closed: no `sorry`. -/

/-- The constant family `A x = ∅` satisfies all hypotheses of the main problem:
each `A x` is bounded (the empty set is bounded) and has Lebesgue outer measure 0 < 1.
Moreover, all of ℝ is an independent set, showing the conclusion holds trivially.

This demonstrates that the hypotheses are non-vacuous: the family `A x = ∅` is a valid
input to the theorem, and `ℝ` (which is infinite) witnesses the conclusion. -/

/-- Two reals form an independent set for the empty family `A _ = ∅`:
neither 0 nor 1 belongs to ∅, so both conditions of `pair_independent_iff` hold. -/

  exact ⟨Set.notMem_empty _, Set.notMem_empty _⟩

/-- The hypothesis `volume.toOuterMeasure (A x) < 1` is strictly satisfied when
`A x = {x}` (a singleton), since Lebesgue measure of a singleton is 0. -/

/-- The boundary case: the measure condition `< 1` is sharp. An interval of length ≥ 1
has Lebesgue measure ≥ 1, so it would fail the hypothesis. Here `[0, 1]` has measure exactly 1. -/
