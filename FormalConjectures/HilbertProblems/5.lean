# Hilbert's Fifth Problem and the Hilbert–Smith Conjecture

The **Hilbert–Smith conjecture** states that a locally compact topological group acting
continuously and faithfully on a connected finite-dimensional topological manifold must be a
Lie group. It remains open in general; Pardon proved it for 3-manifolds in 2013.
An equivalent formulation: no p-adic integer group `ℤ_[p]` can act faithfully on any
connected finite-dimensional topological manifold.
