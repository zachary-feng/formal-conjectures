/--
A natural $n$ is representable as a set $A$ if it can be
written as the sum of finitely many elements of $A$
(with repetition allowed).
-/
abbrev Nat.IsRepresentableAs (n : ℕ) (A : Set ℕ) :=
    ∃ (S : Multiset ℕ), (∀ a ∈ S, a ∈ A) ∧ S.sum = n

/--
The number of naturals that cannot be written as the sum of
finitely many elements of the set $A$, with repetition allowed.
-/
noncomputable abbrev Nat.NcardUnrepresentable (A : Set ℕ) :=
    { n : ℕ | ¬n.IsRepresentableAs A }.ncard

/--
Let $k \le n$. What choice of $A\subseteq\{1, \dots, n\}$ (with $\text{gcd}(A) = 1$) of size $|A| = k$
maximises the number of integers not representable as the sum of finitely
many elements from $A$ (with repetitions allowed)?
Is it $\{n, n - 1, \dots, n - k + 1\}$?

Let $k \le n$. Out of all $A\subseteq\{1, \dots, n\}$ (with $\text{gcd}(A) = 1$) of size $|A| = k$,
does $A = \{n, n - 1, \dots, n - k + 1\}$ maximise the number of integers
not representable as the sum of finitely many elements from $A$ (with repetitions allowed)?
