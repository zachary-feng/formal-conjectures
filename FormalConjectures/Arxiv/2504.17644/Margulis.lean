## Diagonal orbits over function fields (Huang–Shi, Theorem 1.2)

We now formulate a Lean version of the main theorem of Huang–Shi.
Let `F` be a finite field of characteristic `p ∈ {3, 5, 7, 11}`. Set

* `A = F[t]`,
* `K = F((t⁻¹))`.

Denote by `D` the diagonal subgroup of `SL₄(K)` and by `Γ` the lattice
subgroup `SL₄(A)` embedded into `SL₄(K)` via the natural map `A →+* K`.

Then there exists a point `z : SL₄(K)/Γ` such that the `D`-orbit of `z` has
compact closure but is not closed.
