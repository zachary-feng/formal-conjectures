For a finite set $A \subset \mathbb{C}$ and $k \ge 1$, define $A_k$ as the multiset consisting of
all sums of $k$ distinct elements of $A$.

Selfridge and Straus [SeSt58] showed that the conjecture is true when $k = 2$ and
$|A| \ne 2^l$ for $l \ge 0$.
They also gave counterexamples when $k = 2$ and $|A| = 2^l$.

Selfridge and Straus [SeSt58] also showed that the conjecture is true when
1) $k = 3$ and $|A| > 6$ or
2) $k = 4$ and $|A| > 12$.
More generally, they proved that $A$ is determined by $A_k$ (and $|A|$) if $|A|$ is divisible by
a prime greater than $k$.

Kruyt noted that the conjecture fails when $|A| = k$, by rotating $A$ around an appropriate point.

Similarly, Tao noted that the conjecture fails when $|A| = 2k$, by taking $A$ to be a set of
the total sum 0 and considering $-A$.

Gordon, Fraenkel, and Straus [GRS62] proved that the claim is true for all $k > 2$ when
$|A|$ is sufficiently large.

A version in [Er61] by Erdős is product instead of sum, which is false.
Counterexample (by Steinerberger): consider $k = 3$ and let
$A = \{1, \zeta_6, \zeta_6^2, \zeta_6^4\}$ and $B = \{1, \zeta_6^2, \zeta_6^3, \zeta_6^4\}$.
