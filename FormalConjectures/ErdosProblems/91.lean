Suppose $A\subset \mathbb{R}^2$ has $\lvert A\rvert=n$ and minimises the number of distinct
distances between points in $A$. Prove that for large $n$ there are at least two
(and probably many) such $A$ which are non-similar.

For $n = 5$ the regular pentagon is the unique such set (which has two distinct distances).
Erdős mysteriously remarks in [Er90] this was proved by 'a colleague'. (In [Er87b] this is
described as 'a colleague from Zagreb (unfortunately I do not have his letter)'.)
A published proof of this fact is provided by Kovács [Ko24c].
