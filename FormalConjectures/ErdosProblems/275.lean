If a finite system of $r$ congruences $\{ a_i\pmod{n_i} : 1\leq i\leq r\}$ (the $n_i$ are not
necessarily distinct) covers $2^r$ consecutive integers then it covers all integers.

This is best possible as the system $2^{i-1}\pmod{2^i}$ shows. This was proved independently by
Selfridge and Crittenden and Vanden Eynden [CrVE70].

This was formalized in Lean by Alexeev using Aristotle.
