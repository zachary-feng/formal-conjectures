A positive odd integer $k$ is a *Sierpiński number* if $k \cdot 2^n + 1$ is composite for all
$n \geq 0$. A *covering set* for $k$ is a finite set of primes $P$ such that every number of
the form $k \cdot 2^n + 1$ is divisible by at least one prime in $P$.

Sierpiński (1960) proved that infinitely many Sierpiński numbers exist using covering systems.
The smallest known Sierpiński number is 78557 (Selfridge). Erdős and Graham conjectured that
there exist Sierpiński numbers with no finite covering set. A negative answer would imply
infinitely many Fermat primes.

Note: The notion of a covering set for a Sierpiński number is closely related to a
`CoveringSystem` of $\mathbb{Z}$ (see
`FormalConjecturesForMathlib.NumberTheory.CoveringSystem`): a finite covering set of primes
for $k$ works because the exponents $n$ for which each prime divides $k \cdot 2^n + 1$ form
residue classes whose union covers all of $\mathbb{Z}$, i.e. a covering system.

**Erdős Problem 1113.** Do there exist Sierpiński numbers that possess no finite covering set
of primes?

Erdős and Graham [ErGr80] conjectured that the answer is yes. A negative answer would imply
that there are infinitely many Fermat primes.
