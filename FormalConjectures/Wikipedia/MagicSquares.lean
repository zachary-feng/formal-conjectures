Does there exist a $3 \times 3$ matrix such that every entry is a distinct square,
and all rows, columns, and diagonals add up to the same value?

0 is excluded, as a Magic Square of Squares with 0 and 8 distinct squares is know is knownn.

Does there exist a $3 \times 3$ semi-magic square whose entries are all distinct positive
integer cubes? A square is semi-magic if all rows and columns sum to the same total.

More precisely, we seek a $3 \times 3$ matrix with entries $a_{ij}$ such that each
$a_{ij} = n_{ij}^3$ for some positive integer $n_{ij}$, all nine cubes are distinct,
and all row sums and column sums are equal.
