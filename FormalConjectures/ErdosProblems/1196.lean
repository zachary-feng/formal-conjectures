Is it true that, for any $x$, if $A\subset [x,\infty)$ is a primitive set of integers (so that no distinct elements of $A$ divide each other) then$$\sum_{a\in A}\frac{1}{a\log a}&#60; 1+o(1),$$where the $o(1)$ term $\to 0$ as $x\to \infty$?

theorem erdos_1196 :
    answer(True) ↔ ∃ o : ℕ → ℝ, o =o[Filter.atTop] (1 : ℕ → ℝ) ∧ ∀ x > (0 : ℕ), ∀ A ⊆ Set.Ici x, IsPrimitive A →
