/- Formalization notes:
- The problem's greedy recursion ($R_{n+1}(x)=R_n(x)+1/m$ with $m$ minimal such that $m$ does
  not appear in $R_n(x)$ and the right-hand side is $<x$) is rendered as `EventuallyGreedy`:
  from some `n₀` on, the best `n`-term underapproximations form a nested chain given by the
  prefixes of a single strictly increasing sequence of denominators. The two are equivalent:
  if `S` is a best `n`-term underapproximation and `S ∪ {m}` a best `(n+1)`-term one, then `m`
  is forced to be the least `k ∉ S` with `egyptianSum S + 1/k < x` (a smaller admissible `k`
  would give a strictly larger `(n+1)`-term underapproximation), and conversely the greedy
  recursion produces exactly such a nested chain, with the appended denominators strictly
  increasing and exceeding `max S` (else swapping out `max S` would improve `S`).
- "for almost all $x$" is rendered as `∀ᵐ` with respect to Lebesgue measure restricted to
  $(0,\infty)$.

/-- `x` has eventually greedy best Egyptian underapproximations: from some `n₀` on, the best
`n`-term underapproximations of `x` are the prefixes of a single strictly increasing sequence
of denominators, so each is obtained from the previous by appending the minimal admissible
denominator. -/

/--
Let $x>0$ be a real number. For any $n\geq 1$ let
$$R_n(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n\frac{1}{m_i}<x$$
be the maximal sum of $n$ distinct unit fractions which is $<x$.

Is it true that, for almost all $x$, for sufficiently large $n$, we have
$$R_{n+1}(x)=R_n(x)+\frac{1}{m},$$
where $m$ is minimal such that $m$ does not appear in $R_n(x)$ and the right-hand side is
$<x$? (That is, are the best underapproximations eventually always constructed in a 'greedy'
fashion?)

Kovač [Ko24b] has proved that this is false - in fact as false as possible: the set of
$x\in (0,\infty)$ for which the best underapproximations are eventually 'greedy' has Lebesgue
measure zero.
