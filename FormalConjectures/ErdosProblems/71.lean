Is it true that for every infinite arithmetic progression $P$ which contains even numbers
there is some constant $c=c(P)$ such that every graph with average degree at least $c$
contains a cycle whose length is in $P$?

In [Er82e] Erdős credits this conjecture to himself and Burr. This has been proved by
Bollobás [Bo77]. The best dependence of the constant $c(P)$ is unknown.

The infinite arithmetic progression is encoded as a set $P \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ satisfying
`P.IsAPOfLength ⊤` (which forces a positive common difference), and "contains even numbers"
as the existence of an even element. The average degree of a finite simple graph is
`SimpleGraph.averageDegree`, i.e. $(\sum_v \deg v)/|V| \in \mathbb{Q}$, and a cycle whose
length is in $P$ is a cycle walk `w` with `w.length ∈ P`.
