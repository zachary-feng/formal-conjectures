# Sum of a triangular number, a generalized pentagonal number, and a generalized heptagonal number

Any nonnegative integer can be written as $x(x+1)/2 + y(3y+1)/2 + z(5z+1)/2$ with $x, y, z$
nonnegative integers.

Zhi-Wei Sun has offered a USD 135 prize for the first proof of this conjecture.

**Zhi-Wei Sun's Conjecture (A287616)**: Any nonnegative integer can be written as the sum of
a triangular number $x(x+1)/2$, a generalized pentagonal number $y(3y+1)/2$, and a generalized
heptagonal number $z(5z+1)/2$, where $x, y, z$ are nonnegative integers.
