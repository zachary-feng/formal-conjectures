Let $F(x)$ be the maximal $k$ such that there exist $n+1, \dots, n+k \le x$
with $τ(n+1), \dots, τ(n+k)$ all distinct, where $τ(m)$ counts the divisors of $m$. -/

-- Implementation note: we define a Prop here and below to be able to easily formulate
-- the equivalence between the two variants. Because the theorems require `answer(sorry)` we
-- can't handle this with `type_of%`.

/--
Is it true that $F(x) \leq (\log x)^{O(1)}$?

/--
Is there a constant $C > 0$ such that, for all large $x$, every interval $[x, x+(\log x)C]$
contains two integers with the same number of divisors?
