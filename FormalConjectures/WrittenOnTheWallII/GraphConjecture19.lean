WOWII [Conjecture 19](http://cms.dt.uh.edu/faculty/delavinae/research/wowII/)

If `G` is connected then the size `b(G)` of a largest induced bipartite subgraph
satisfies
`b(G) ≥ FLOOR((∑ ecc(v))/(|V|) + sSup (range (l G)))`, where `ecc(v)` denotes
eccentricity and `l(G)` is the independence number of neighbourhoods.
