**Prikry–Mills counterexample** (key lemma):

There exists a 2-colouring $f$ of a set of cardinality $\aleph_1$ cubed such that
no countable box $A_1 \times B_1 \times C_1$ is monochromatic.

This is the unpublished result of Prikry and Mills (1978). The proof proceeds by
transfinite induction along $\omega_1$, which has uncountable cofinality, ensuring
every countable box is non-monochromatic.

**Erdős Problem 1128** (disproved by Prikry–Mills, 1978):

Erdős asked whether every 2-colouring of $A \times B \times C$, where
$|A| = |B| = |C| = \aleph_1$, must contain a monochromatic countable box
$A_1 \times B_1 \times C_1$ with $|A_1| = |B_1| = |C_1| = \aleph_0$.

The answer is **No**: Prikry and Mills constructed a 2-colouring of $\omega_1^3$
with no monochromatic countable box.

Note: The positive statement asserts that every 2-colouring of every $\aleph_1^3$
contains a monochromatic countably infinite box. Since the answer is False, this
positive statement fails.

**Explicit form of Prikry–Mills**:

There exists a 2-colouring of $\omega_1 \times \omega_1 \times \omega_1$ such that
for every countably infinite $A_1, B_1, C_1 \subseteq \omega_1$, the box
$A_1 \times B_1 \times C_1$ is not monochromatic.

This is the content of the Prikry–Mills theorem (1978, unpublished), stated
using Lean's ordinal type `{o : Ordinal // o < ω_ 1}` as the
representation of $\omega_1$.

The claim that every 2-colouring of $\omega_1 \times \omega_1$ has an uncountable
monochromatic product rectangle is **false** in ZFC.

**Counterexample:** The ordering colouring $f(\alpha, \beta) = 0$ iff $\alpha < \beta$
has no uncountable monochromatic product rectangle $A_1 \times B_1$.

**Proof:** If $A_1 \times B_1$ were monochromatic with colour 0, then every element of
$A_1$ would be strictly less than every element of $B_1$, making $A_1$ bounded above in
$\omega_1$; but any bounded subset of $\omega_1$ is countable (since initial segments are
countable), contradicting $A_1$ being uncountable. The colour-1 case is symmetric with
the roles of $A_1$ and $B_1$ swapped.

Note: The correct classical result for 2-colourings of pairs (not products) is the
Erdős–Rado theorem $\omega_1 \to (\omega_1)^2_2$, which concerns unordered pairs.
