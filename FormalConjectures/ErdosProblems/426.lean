We say $H$ is a unique subgraph of $G$ if there is exactly one way to find $H$ as a subgraph
(not necessarily induced) of $G$. Is there a graph on $n$ vertices with
$$\gg \frac{2^{\binom{n}{2}}}{n!}$$
many distinct unique subgraphs?

Bradač and Christoph [BrCh24] have proved the answer is no: if $f(n)$ is the maximum number of
unique subgraphs in a graph on $n$ vertices then
$$f(n) = o\left(\frac{2^{\binom{n}{2}}}{n!}\right).$$

The $\gg$ below is read as: some constant $c>0$ works for arbitrarily large $n$. The negation
of the proposition on the right is then exactly $f(n) = o(2^{\binom{n}{2}}/n!)$, the form in
which Bradač and Christoph [BrCh24] resolved the problem.
