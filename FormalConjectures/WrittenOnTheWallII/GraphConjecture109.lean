WOWII [Conjecture 109](http://cms.dt.uh.edu/faculty/delavinae/research/wowII/)

For a simple connected graph $G$, the independence number $\alpha(G)$ satisfies
$\alpha(G) \le \lfloor (\mathrm{residue}(G) + 2 \cdot b(G)) / 3 \rfloor$, where
$\mathrm{residue}(G)$ is the Havel-Hakimi residue and $b(G)$ is the size of a
largest induced bipartite subgraph.

See: Favaron, Mahéo, Saclé (1991) for the residue; DeLaVina's Graffiti.pc for the conjecture.

step gives $[0]$, leaving a single zero. -/
