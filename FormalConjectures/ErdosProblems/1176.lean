Let $G$ be a graph with chromatic number $\aleph_1$. Is it true that there is a colouring of the
edges with $\aleph_1$ many colours such that, in any countable colouring of the vertices, there
exists a vertex colour containing all edge colours?

A problem of Erdős, Galvin, and Hajnal. The consistency of this was proved by Hajnal and Komjáth.
