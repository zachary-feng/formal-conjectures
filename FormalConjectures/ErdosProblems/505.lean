# Erdős Problem 505

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/505](https://www.erdosproblems.com/505)

**Borsuk's conjecture** (1933): Is every bounded set of diameter 1 in $\mathbb{R}^n$
the union of at most $n + 1$ sets of diameter strictly less than 1?

Erdős [Er44] suspected this is false for sufficiently large $n$. Confirmed
by Kahn–Kalai [KK93], who disproved the conjecture for $n \geq 2015$.
The current best is $n \geq 64$ (Jenrich–Brouwer, 2014).

The conjecture is true for $n \leq 3$ (Eggleston [Eg55] for $n = 3$).

/-- **Erdős Problem 505** (disproved). Borsuk's conjecture is false for
sufficiently large $n$: there exists a dimension $n$ and a bounded set
$S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ with positive diameter such that $S$ cannot be
covered by $n + 1$ subsets each of diameter strictly less than $\operatorname{diam}(S)$.

Erdős [Er44] suspected this. Disproved by Kahn–Kalai [KK93] for
$n \geq 2015$. Currently known to be false for $n \geq 64$.
A formal proof was formalised by Boris Alexeev using Aristotle. -/

/-- **Borsuk's conjecture, small dimensions** (open / true for $n \leq 3$).
Every bounded set $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ with $n \leq 3$ can be
covered by $n + 1$ subsets each of strictly smaller diameter.

Trivial for $n \leq 2$; proved for $n = 3$ by Eggleston [Eg55]. -/
