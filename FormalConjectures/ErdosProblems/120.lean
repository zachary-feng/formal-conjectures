There exists a set $E \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, dependent on set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$,
of positive measure which does not contain any set of the shape $a * A + b$
for some $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ and $a \neq 0$?

/--
Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be an infinite set. Must there be a set $E \subseteq \mathbb{R}$
of positive measure which does not contain any set of the shape $a * A + b$
for some $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ and $a \neq 0$?

Steinhaus [St20] has proved Erdős 120 to be false whenever $A$ is a finite set.
