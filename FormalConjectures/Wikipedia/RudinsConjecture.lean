/-- $Q(N; q, a)$ is the number of perfect squares among the first $N$ terms of the arithmetic
progression $\{q n + a : 0 \le n < N\}$. -/

$\gcd(q, a) = 1$, and $(q, a) \neq (1, 1)$. -/

/-- $Q(N) = \max Q(N; q, a)$, the largest number of perfect squares occurring among the first
$N$ terms of any non-trivial arithmetic progression. The supremum is over a set of naturals that
is bounded above by $N$ (each progression has only $N$ terms), so it is attained. -/

/-- Sanity check pinning `Q` to a concrete value: among the first `6` terms of `24 n + 1`, namely
`1, 25, 49, 73, 97, 121`, exactly four are perfect squares (`1, 25, 49, 121`), so
`Q 6 24 1 = 4`. This validates the definition of `Q` and matches the claim that `24 n + 1` is the
extremal progression. -/

**Rudin's conjecture.** The maximal number of squares among the first $N$ terms of a non-trivial
arithmetic progression grows at most like $\sqrt{N}$:
$$Q(N) = O(\sqrt{N}).$$

A stronger form of Rudin's conjecture: for every $N \ge 6$, the arithmetic progression
$24 n + 1$ attains the maximum $Q(N)$.

/--
The strongest form of Rudin's conjecture also asserts *uniqueness*: for $N \ge 6$, any non-trivial
arithmetic progression attaining the maximum $Q(N)$ has common difference $24$. (Its initial term
is then forced by $\gcd(24, a) = 1$; the progression $24n + 1$ is the canonical representative.)
