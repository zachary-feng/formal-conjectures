# Tests for the answer linter

This file contains test cases for the `AnswerLinter`, verifying that it correctly flags
theorems with early arguments when `answer(sorry)` is the left-hand side of an iff,
and does not flag theorems without `answer(sorry)` or without early arguments.

warning: Move the quantifiers outward:
instead of
`theorem foo (bar : ℕ) (baz : ℕ) : answer(sorry) ↔ ...`
likely the intention was
`theorem foo : answer(sorry) ↔ ∀ᵉ (bar : ℕ) (baz : ℕ), ...`

Note: This linter can be disabled with `set_option linter.style.answer_attribute false`
