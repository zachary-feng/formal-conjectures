WOWII [Conjecture 32](http://cms.dt.uh.edu/faculty/delavinae/research/wowII/)

For a simple connected graph $G$,
$\operatorname{path}(G) \ge \operatorname{dist}\_{\operatorname{avg}}(A) + 0.5 \cdot \operatorname{ecc}\_{\operatorname{avg}}(M)$,
where $\operatorname{path}(G)$ is the floor of the average distance of $G$, $A$ is the
set of minimum-degree vertices, $M$ is the set of maximum-degree vertices,
$\operatorname{dist}\_{\operatorname{avg}}(A)$ is the average distance from all vertices
to $A$, and $\operatorname{ecc}\_{\operatorname{avg}}(M)$ is the average eccentricity
of the vertices in $M$.

The conjecture is false, the authors present a counterexample: "The path on 5 vertices
is a counterexample, path = 5, distavg(A) = 4 and the average of eccentricity of maximum
degree vertices is 8/3."
