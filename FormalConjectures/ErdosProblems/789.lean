# Erdős Problem 789

In this problem, a function $h : \mathbb{N} \to\mathbb{N}$ is defined maximally by
some counting property.

The problem asks to estimate $h(n)$. This has been interpreted here as asking for $\Theta(h(n))$.
The principal version includes `answer(sorry)` for an unknown function. On the other hand, the best
known upper bound is $\sqrt{n}$ and the best known lower bound is $(n\log(n))^{1/3}$ so we
also provide these candidates as variants. Moreover, it suffices to show $O(h(n))$ and
$O((n\log(n))^{1/3})$ respectively for each, so further variants are provided for those.

/-- Given a non-negative integer $n$, we say $m$ is a separating cardinality of
subset sums if, for any set $A$ of $n$ integers, there is some $B\subseteq A$ of
size $\geq m$ such that subset sums of $B$ can only ever coincide when the
subsets have the same cardinality. -/

Let $h(n)$ be maximal such that if $A\subseteq \mathbb{Z}$ with $\lvert A\rvert=n$
then there is $B\subseteq A$ with $\lvert B\rvert \geq h(n)$ such that if
$a_1+\cdots+a_r=b_1+\cdots+b_s$ with $a_i,b_i\in B$ then $r=s$.

Estimate $h(n)$.
