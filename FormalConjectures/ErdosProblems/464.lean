/- Formalization notes:
- Since every $\|\theta n_k\|$ lies in $[0,1/2]$, the literal reading of "$\{\|\theta n_k\|\}$
  is not dense in $[0,1]$" would be vacuously true. The intended (and solved) content is that
  the sequence $(\theta n_k)$ is not dense modulo one, which is how the conclusion is rendered
  here: `¬ Dense (Set.range fun k => (↑(θ * n k) : AddCircle (1 : ℝ)))`. This matches
  `pollington_de_mathan` in `Problem10_6.lean` of the Bugeaud collection, which formalizes the
  full-Hausdorff-dimension version of the same de Mathan–Pollington theorem. It is implied by
  the $\inf_{k\geq 1}\|\theta n_k\| > 0$ that de Mathan and Pollington prove.
- The lacunarity hypothesis is rendered by the house predicate `IsLacunary`
  ($\exists c > 1$ with $c \cdot n_k < n_{k+1}$ for all sufficiently large $k$), as in
  `erdos_355`; for a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers the problem's condition
  $n_{k+1} \geq (1+\epsilon) n_k$ for all $k$ implies `IsLacunary`, and modifying finitely many
  terms does not affect density modulo one.

/--
Let $A=\{n_1<n_2<\cdots\}\subset \mathbb{N}$ be a lacunary sequence (so there exists some
$\epsilon>0$ with $n_{k+1}\geq (1+\epsilon)n_k$ for all $k$). Must there exist an irrational
$\theta$ such that
$$\{ \|\theta n_k\| : k\geq 1\}$$
is not dense in $[0,1]$ (where $\| x\|$ is the distance to the nearest integer)?

Solved independently by de Mathan [dM80] and Pollington [Po79b], who showed that, given any
such $A$, there exists such a $\theta$, with
$$\inf_{k\geq 1}\| \theta n_k\| \gg \frac{\epsilon^4}{\log(1/\epsilon)}.$$
This bound was improved by Katznelson [Ka01], Akhunzhanov and Moshchevitin [AkMo04], and
Dubickas [Du06], before Peres and Schlag [PeSc10] improved it to
$$\inf_{k\geq 1}\| \theta n_k\| \gg \frac{\epsilon}{\log(1/\epsilon)},$$
and note that the best bound possible here would be $\gg \epsilon$.

This problem has consequences for [894](https://www.erdosproblems.com/894).

The conclusion "$\{\|\theta n_k\|\}$ is not dense in $[0,1]$" is formalized as the sequence
$(\theta n_k)$ not being dense modulo one; see the formalization notes above.
