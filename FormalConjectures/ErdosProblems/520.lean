A random function $f$ is Rademacher multiplicative if $f(1) = 1$,
for each prime $p$, we independently choose $f(p) \in \{-1, 1\}$ uniformly at random,
for each square-free integer $n = p_1 \cdots p_r$, $f(n) = f(p_1) \cdots f(p_r)$, and
for each non-squarefree integer $n$, $f(n) = 0$.

Let $f$ be a Rademacher multiplicative function.
Does there exist some constant $c > 0$ such that, almost surely,
$$
  \limsup_{N \to \infty} \frac{\sum_{m \leq N} f(m)}{\sqrt{N \log \log N}} = c?
