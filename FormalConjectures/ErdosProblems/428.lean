/--
The density ratio of set $A$ up to $n$ relative to the prime counting function $\pi(n)$.

noncomputable def primeDensityRatio (A : Set ℕ) (n : ℕ) : ℝ :=
  (A ∩ Icc 1 n).ncard / (primeCounting n)

/--
Is there a set $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ such that, for infinitely many $n$, all of $n-a$
are prime for all $a\in A$ with $0 < a < n$ and $$\liminf\frac{\lvert A\cap [1,x]\rvert}{\pi(x)}>0?$$
