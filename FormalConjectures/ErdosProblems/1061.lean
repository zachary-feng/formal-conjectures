/-- Let `S x` count the number of **ordered** pairs of positive integers `(a, b)` with `a + b ≤ x`
such that `σ(a) + σ(b) = σ(a + b)`, where `σ` is the sum of divisors function.

In particular, `(a, b)` and `(b, a)` are counted separately; an unordered variant could be obtained
by additionally requiring `a ≤ b`. -/

      a + b ≤ x ∧ σ 1 a + σ 1 b = σ 1 (a + b)).card

/--
How many (ordered) solutions are there to `σ(a) + σ(b) = σ(a + b)` with `a + b ≤ x`?
Is it true that this number is asymptotic to `c * x` for some constant `c > 0`?
