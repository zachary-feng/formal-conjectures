Let $t_k(n)$ denote the least $m$ such that $n\mid m(m+1)(m+2)\cdots (m+k-1).$

Is it true that $\sum_{n\leq x}t_2(n)\ll \frac{x^2}{(\log x)^c}$ for some $c>0$?

Is it true that, for $k\geq 2$, $\sum_{n\leq x}t_{k+1}(n) =o\left(\sum_{n\leq x}t_k(n)\right)?$

In [ErGr80] they mention a conjecture of Erdős that the sum is $o(x^2)$. This was proved by Erdős
and Hall [ErHa78], who proved that in fact
$\sum_{n\leq x}t_2(n)\ll \frac{\log\log\log x}{\log\log x}x^2.$

Erdős and Hall conjecture that the sum is $o(x^2/(\log x)^c)$ for any $c<\log 2$.

Since $t_2(p)=p-1$ for prime $p$ it is trivial that $\sum_{n\leq x}t_2(n)\gg \frac{x^2}{\log x}$.

They ask about the behaviour of $t_{n-3}(n!)$ and also ask whether, for infinitely many $n$,
$t_k(n!)< t_{k-1}(n!)-1$ for all $1\leq k < n$.

They proved (with Selfridge) that this holds for $n=10$.
