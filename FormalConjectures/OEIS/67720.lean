# Conjectures associated with A067720

A067720 lists numbers $k$ such that $\varphi(k^2 + 1) = k \cdot \varphi(k + 1)$,
where $\varphi$ is Euler's totient function.

The sequence exhibits a strong connection to primes: for almost all terms $k$,
$k + 1$ is prime. The conjecture states that $k = 8$ is the only exception.
