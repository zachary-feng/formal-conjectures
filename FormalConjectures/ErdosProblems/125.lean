# Erdős Problem 125

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/125](https://www.erdosproblems.com/125)

There are four possibilities for the density of $A+B$:
1. $A+B$ has zero upper and lower density (and hence also zero density).
2. $A+B$ has zero lower density, but positive upper density (and hence no density).
3. $A+B$ has positive upper and lower density that are equal (and hence positive density).
4. $A+B$ has positive upper and lower density that are unequal (and hence no density).

Case 3:
Does $A + B$ have positive upper and lower density that are equal?
This is the literal interpretation of "positive density" which was falsified.

This follows from the disproof `erdos_125.variants.positive_lower_density` above.
