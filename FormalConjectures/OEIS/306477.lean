# The 2-4-6-8 Conjecture

Any integer $n > 0$ can be written as $\binom{w+2}{2} + \binom{x+3}{4} + \binom{y+5}{6} + \binom{z+7}{8}$
with $w, x, y, z$ nonnegative integers.

Zhi-Wei Sun has offered a $2,468 prize for the first proof (or $2,468 RMB for a counterexample).

The conjecture has been verified for all $n$ up to $1.2 \times 10^{12}$ by Yaakov Baruch (March 2019).
