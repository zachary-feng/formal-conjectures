/-- The set of rational numbers of the form `P(n) + 1 / n` where `n` is a natural number
and `P` is a polynomial with rational coefficients.

Note: We include `P 0` in there (since `1 / 0 = 0`), but this doesn't change the validity of the
conjecture -/

large integer is a sum of elements of the set `A \ B`. -/

Let $p(x) \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ be a non-constant rational polynomial with positive leading
coefficient. Is it true that $$A=\{ p(n)+1/n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$$ is strongly complete,
in the sense that, for any finite set $B$,
$$\left\{\sum_{a \in X} a : X \subseteq A \setminus B, X \textrm{ is finite}\right\}$$
contains all sufficiently large integers? -/

    answer(True) ↔ ∀ P : ℚ[X], 0 < P.natDegree → 0 < P.leadingCoeff → HasCompleteImage P := by
  sorry

/--
Let $p(x) = x \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$. It has been shown that
$$A=\{ p(n)+1/n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$$
is strongly complete, in the sense that, for any finite set $B$,
$$\left\{\sum_{a \in X} a : X \subseteq A \setminus B, X \textrm{ is finite}\right\}$$
contains all sufficiently large integers.
