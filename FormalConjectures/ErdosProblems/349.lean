This defines the core property of the problem: For what values of $t,\alpha \in (0,\infty)$
is the sequence $\lfloor t\alpha^n\rfloor$ complete?

/--
For what values of $t,\alpha \in (0,\infty)$ is the sequence $\lfloor t\alpha^n\rfloor$ complete
(that is, all sufficiently large integers are the sum of distinct integers of the form $\lfloor t\alpha^n\rfloor$)?

It seems likely that the sequence is complete for all
for all $t>0$ and all $1 < \alpha < \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$.

For any $k$ there exists some $t_k\in (0,1)$ such that the set of $\alpha$
such that the sequence $\lfloor t_k\alpha^n\rfloor$ is complete consists of at least $k$
disjoint line segments.

often and even infinitely often?

  sorry

/-- For $\alpha > 2$ and any $t > 0$, the sequence $\lfloor t\alpha^n\rfloor$ is not additively
complete; equivalently $(t, \alpha)$ is not a "good pair". A partial result on the open Erdős
Problem 349: it complements `complete_for_alpha_in_Ioo_one_to_goldenRatio`.

The proof is recorded via the `formal_proof` mechanism rather than written inline, as it exceeds
the repository's proof-length guideline. -/

theorem alpha_gt_two_not_isGoodPair (t α : ℝ) (ht : 0 < t) (hα : 2 < α) : ¬ IsGoodPair t α := by
  sorry

/-- For $0 < \alpha \le 1$ and any $t > 0$, $(t, \alpha)$ is not a good pair: every term
$\lfloor t\alpha^n\rfloor$ lies in the finite interval $[0, \lfloor t\rfloor]$ (since
$\alpha^n \le 1$), so every subset sum is bounded by the constant $\sum_{i \in [0,\lfloor t\rfloor]} i$,
and no large integer can be a subset sum. A partial result on the open Erdős Problem 349,
complementing the $2 < \alpha$ and integer-coefficient cases. -/

/-- **Binary expansion.** Every natural number $k$ is a sum of distinct powers of two: there is
a finite set $E$ of exponents with $k = \sum_{i \in E} 2^i$. Proved by strong induction:
subtract the largest power $2^m \le k$, recurse on the remainder. -/

additively complete set: every $k \ge 1$ is a finite sum of distinct powers of two. -/

  sorry

/-- **The dyadic fiber at $\alpha = 2$.** For every $k$, the pair $(1/2^k, 2)$ is good: the
sequence $\lfloor 2^n / 2^k\rfloor$ is additively complete because at index $n = m + k$ it equals
the exact power $2^m$, so its range contains all powers of two, which already form an additively
complete set. Uses monotonicity `IsAddComplete.mono`. -/

/-- **Integer leading coefficient $t \ge 2$ blocks completeness.** For every integer base
$\alpha$, the pair $(t, \alpha)$ with integer $t \ge 2$ is not good: $\lfloor t\alpha^n\rfloor =
t\alpha^n$ is a multiple of $t$, so every subset sum is too, but two consecutive large integers
cannot both be multiples of $t$. Generalizes the parity obstruction ($t = 2$). A partial result
on Erdős Problem 349. -/

/-- **Erdős Problem 349, complete characterization on positive integer pairs.** For integers
$t \ge 1$, $\alpha \ge 1$, the pair $(t, \alpha)$ is good (i.e. $\lfloor t\alpha^n\rfloor$ is
additively complete) iff $(t, \alpha) = (1, 2)$. Assembles the four partial results: $(1,2)$ is
good, $\alpha \le 1$ fails, $2 < \alpha$ fails (`alpha_gt_two_not_isGoodPair`), and integer
$t \ge 2$ fails. -/
