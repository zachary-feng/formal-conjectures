The length of a subset $s$ of $\mathbb{C}$ is defined to be its 1-dimensional
Hausdorff measure $\mathcal{H}^1(s)$.

**Erdős–Herzog–Piranian Component Lemma** (Metric Properties of Polynomials, 1958):
If $f$ is a monic degree $n$ polynomial with all roots in the unit disk,
then some connected component
of $\{z \mid |f(z)| < 1\}$ contains at least two roots with multiplicity.

Let
$$ f(z) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} (z - z_i) \in \mathbb{C}[x] $$
with $|z_i| < 1$ for all $i$.

Conjecture: Must there always exist a path of length less than 2 in
$$ \{ z \in \mathbb{C} \mid |f(z)| < 1 \} $$
which connects two of the roots of $f$?
