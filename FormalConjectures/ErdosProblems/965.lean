# Erdős Problem 965

For every 2-coloring of ℝ, is there an uncountable set $A ⊆ ℝ$ such that
all sums $a + b$ for $a, b ∈ A, a ≠ b$ have the same colour?

Erdős asks in [Er75b] if for every 2-coloring of ℝ, there is an uncountable set $A ⊆ ℝ$ such that
all sums $a + b$ for $a, b ∈ A, a ≠ b$ have the same colour.

In [Ko16] Péter Komjáth constructed a counterexample.
The same result was proven independently in [SWCol] by Sokoup and Weiss.

theorem erdos_965 :
    answer(False) ↔ ∀ f : ℝ → Fin 2, ∃ A : Set ℝ, ¬ A.Countable ∧
      ∀ᵉ (a ∈ A) (b ∈ A) (c ∈ A) (d ∈ A), a ≠ b → c ≠ d → f (a + b) = f (c + d) := by
  sorry

In fact, in both [Ko16] and [SWCol] a generalized example for $k$-sums is constructed.
