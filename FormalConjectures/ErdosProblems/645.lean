/--
If ℕ is $2$-coloured then there must exist a monochromatic three-term arithmetic progression
$x,x+d,x+2d$ such that $d>x$.

This was first proved by Brown and Landman [BrLa99], who in fact show that this is always possible
with $d>f(x)$ for any increasing function $f$.

This was formalized in Lean by Alexeev using Aristotle and ChatGPT.
