Is it true that in any 2-colouring of $\mathbb{N}$ there exists an infinite set $A$
such that all elements of $A+A$ are the same colour?

A conjecture of Owings [Ow74].

theorem erdos_1199 :
    answer(sorry) ↔
    ∀ (color : ℕ → Fin 2), ∃ (A : Set ℕ),
    A.Infinite ∧ ∀ n ∈ (A+A), ∀ m ∈ (A+A), color n = color m := by
  sorry

/--
Hindman [Hi79] has shown that this is false for 3-colourings.
