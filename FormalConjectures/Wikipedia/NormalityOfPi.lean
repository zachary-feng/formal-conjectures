# Normality of mathematical constants

Despite extensive empirical evidence—billions of digits have been computed for $\pi$,
$e$, and $\sqrt{2}$, all showing near-uniform digit distribution—it is an open problem
whether any of the classical constants $\pi$, $e$, $\sqrt{2}$, $\ln 2$, or $\varphi$ is
normal in any base.
