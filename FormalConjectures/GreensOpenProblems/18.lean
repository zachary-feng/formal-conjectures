The number of triples $(x, y, g)$ in $G^3$ such that $g \neq e$, and $(x, y), (gx, y), (x, gy)$ are
all in $A$. These are called "naive corners" by [Au16].

Note: the shortened formulation from [Gr26] does not mention $g \neq e$, but this is the original
statement from [Au16], which ensure non-trivial corners. Note however that [Au16] use more
generally compact groups and not just finite discrete groups.

Suppose that $G$ is a finite group, and let $A \subset G \times G$ be a subset of density $\alpha$.
Is it true that there are $\gg_\alpha |G|^3$ triples $x, y, g$ such that $(x, y), (gx, y), (x, gy)$
all lie in $A$?

Note: A is taken as $\alpha$-dense, i.e. $|A| \ge \alpha |G|^2$ [Au16, Question 2]

The number of triples $(x, y, g)$ in $G^3$ such that $g \neq e$, and $(x, y), (xg, y), (x, gy)$ are
all in $A$. These are called "BMZ corners" by [Au16].

[So13] proved this is true for "BMZ corners". Follows from the proof of Theorem 2.1, p.1456-1457.
