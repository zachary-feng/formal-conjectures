/-- If `f(z) = ∑ aₖzⁿₖ` is an entire function (with `aₖ ≠ 0` for all `k`) such that `nₖ / k → ∞`,
is it true that `f` assumes every value infinitely often? -/

/-- If `f(z) = ∑ aₖzⁿₖ` is an entire function (with `aₖ ≠ 0` for all `k`) such that `∑ 1 / nₖ < ∞`,
then `f` assumes every value infinitely often. This theorem is proved in [Bi28]. -/
