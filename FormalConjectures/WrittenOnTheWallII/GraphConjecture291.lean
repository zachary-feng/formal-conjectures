# Written on the Wall II - Conjecture 291

*Reference:*
[E. DeLaVina, Written on the Wall II, Conjectures of Graffiti.pc](http://cms.dt.uh.edu/faculty/delavinae/research/wowII/)

## Definitions

For a vertex $v$ in a graph $G$, **$T(v)$** is the number of triangles (3-cliques)
incident to $v$, i.e., the number of 3-element cliques in $G$ that contain $v$.

The **triangle-frequency of the minimum** is the number of vertices that achieve the
minimum value of $T(v)$.

**$k$** is the **first step in the Havel–Hakimi process at which a zero appears**.
Concretely, starting from the descending degree sequence $s_0$ of $G$, we set
$s_{i+1} = \mathrm{havelHakimiStep}\, s_i$ and let $k$ be the least $i \ge 0$ such
that $s_i$ contains a zero entry (or, vacuously, has been emptied entirely). Since
each step is sorted descending and never increases entries, this is equivalent
to the last (smallest) entry of $s_i$ being $0$, or $s_i$ being $[]$.

This is **strictly weaker** than $n - \mathrm{residue}(G)$: $n - \mathrm{residue}(G)$
is the *total* number of reduction steps until *every* entry is zero, whereas $k$
only requires that *some* entry has hit zero — and a $0$ typically appears well
before the all-zero state is reached.

**Conjecture 291:** For a simple connected graph $G$ with $n > 2$,
$\gamma_t(G) \le k + \mathrm{frequency}(t_{\min}(v))$
where $\gamma_t(G)$ is the total domination number, $k$ is the Havel-Hakimi zero
step, and $\mathrm{frequency}(t_{\min}(v))$ is the number of vertices achieving
the minimum triangle count.

Uses `Finset.univ.val.map` (multiset, duplicate-preserving) rather than
`Finset.univ.image` (set, deduplicating), so that e.g. $C_4$ produces
$[2, 2, 2, 2]$ rather than $[2]$. -/

/-- The first step $i$ (counting from $0$) at which a zero appears in the
Havel-Hakimi reduction of the descending degree sequence of $G$, or in which
the sequence has been emptied. We use `sInf` over the set of such $i$ so the
definition is well-defined for every graph: in particular, when $G$ is a
connected graph with $n \ge 2$ the minimum degree at iteration $0$ is at least
$1$, so the first zero only appears at some $i \ge 1$; and since each step
strictly shortens the list (or empties it), at the latest by $i = n$ the
sequence is empty and the predicate holds vacuously.

This is the WOWII $k$ of Conjecture 291, which is the **first** step at which a
zero appears — typically strictly less than $n - \mathrm{residue}(G)$ (which is
the *total* number of reduction steps to reach the all-zero state). -/

For a simple connected graph $G$ with $n > 2$,
$\gamma_t(G) \le k + \mathrm{frequency}(t_{\min}(v))$
where:

- $\gamma_t(G)$ is the total domination number,
- $k$ is the first step in which a zero appears in the Havel-Hakimi process,
- $\mathrm{frequency}(t_{\min}(v))$ is the number of vertices achieving the
  minimum triangle count.
