# Erdős Problem 370

/--
Are there infinitely many $n$ such that the largest prime factor of $n$ is $< n^{\frac{1}{2}}$ and
the largest prime factor of $n + 1$ is $< (n + 1)^{\frac{1}{2}}$.

Steinerberger has pointed out this problem has a trivial solution.

This was formalized in Lean by Alexeev using Aristotle.
