/--
Let $\epsilon>0$. Is it true that, for all large $n$, the number of divisors of $n$ in
$(n^{1/2},n^{1/2}+n^{1/2-\epsilon})$ is $O_\epsilon(1)$?

Erdős attributes this conjecture to Ruzsa.

Erdős and Rosenfeld [ErRo97] proved that there are infinitely many $n$ such that there are
four divisors of $n$ in $(n^{1/2},n^{1/2}+16n^{1/4})$.

Erdős and Rosenfeld [ErRo97] proved that, for any constant $C>0$, all large $n$ have at most
$1+C^2$ many divisors in $[n^{1/2}, n^{1/2}+Cn^{1/4}]$.
