Can there exist two distinct integers $x$ and $y$ such that $x,y$ have the same prime factors,
$x+1,y+1$ have the same prime factors, and $x+2,y+2$ also have the same prime factors?

theorem erdos_850 :
    answer(sorry) ↔ ∃ x y : ℕ, x ≠ y ∧ x.primeFactors = y.primeFactors
      ∧ (x + 1).primeFactors = (y + 1).primeFactors
      ∧ (x + 2).primeFactors = (y + 2).primeFactors := by
