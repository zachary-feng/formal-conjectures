Let $1\leq u_1 < u_2 < \cdots$ be the sequence of integers with at most $2$ prime factors.
Is it true that $$\limsup_{k \to \infty} \frac{u_{k+1}-u_k}{\log k}=\infty?$$

theorem erdos_1139 :
    answer(sorry) ↔
      letI u := Nat.nth (fun n ↦ 0 < n ∧ Ω n ≤ 2)
      atTop.limsup (fun k : ℕ ↦ (((u (k + 1) : ℝ) - (u k : ℝ)) / Real.log (↑k + 1) : EReal)) = ⊤ := by
  sorry
