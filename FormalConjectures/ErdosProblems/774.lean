We call $A\subset \mathbb{N}$ dissociated if $\sum_{n\in X}n\neq \sum_{m\in Y}m$
for all finite $X,Y\subset A$ with $X\neq Y$.

def Set.IsDissociated (A : Set ℕ) : Prop :=
  { S : Finset ℕ | (S : Set ℕ) ⊆ A }.InjOn fun S ↦ ∑ n ∈ S, n

/-- We call $A$ proportionately dissociated if every finite $B\subset A$
contains a dissociated set of size $\gg \lvert B\rvert$.

In other words, there is a (global) $c > 0$ such that every finite $B \subset A$
contains a dissociated set of size $\geq c|B|$. -/

number of dissociated sets?-/
