Let  $3 \le d_1 < d_2 < \dots < d_r$ be integers such that
$$\sum_{1 \le i \le r}\frac 1{d_i - 1} \ge 1.$$
Can all sufficiently large integers be written as a sum of the shape $\sum_i c_ia_i$
where $c_i \in \{0, 1\}$ and $a_i$ has only the digits $0, 1$ when written in base $d_i$?

Conjectured by Erdős [Er97], solved by Boris Alexeev using Aristotle.

Let $k \ne 0$ and $3\leq d_1 < d_2 < \cdots < d_r$ be integers of gcd equal to $1$ such that
$$\sum_{1 \le i \le r}\frac 1{d_i - 1} \ge 1.$$
Can all sufficiently large integers be written as a sum of the shape $\sum_i c_ia_i$
where $c_i \in \{0, 1\}$ and $a_i$ is divisible by $d_i ^ k$ and has only the digits $0, 1$ when
written in base $d_i$?

All sufficiently large integers can be written as $a + b + c$ where $a$ has only the digits $0, 1$
in base $3$, $b$ only the digits $0, 1$ in base $4$, $c$ only the digits $0, 1$ in base $7$.

Let $3\leq d_1 < d_2 < \cdots < d_r$ be integers such that all sufficiently large integers can be
written as a sum of the shape $\sum_i c_ia_i$ where $c_i \in \{0, 1\}$ and $a_i$ has only the digits
$0, 1$ when written in base $d_i$. Then
$$\sum_{1 \le i \le r}\frac 1{d_i - 1} \ge 1.$$

For any $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists an infinite sequence $2 \le d_0 < d_1 < \dots$ such
that all sufficiently large integer can be written as $\sum_{i \in I} a_i$ where $a_i$ has only
the digits $0, 1$ when written in base $d_i$,
but $\sum_{i \in I} \frac 1{d_i - 1} \le \varepsilon$.
