namespace ComplexityTheory

/--
The type of decision problems.

We define these as functions from lists of booleans to booleans,
implictly assuming the usual encodings.
-/
abbrev DecisionProblem := List Bool → Bool

/--
The type of complexity classes. We define these as sets of decision problems.
-/
abbrev ComplexityClass := Set DecisionProblem

/--
A simple definition to abstract the notion of a poly-time Turing machine into a predicate.
-/
def IsComputableInPolyTime {α β : Type} (ea : FinEncoding α) (eb : FinEncoding β) (f : α → β) :=
  Nonempty (TM2ComputableInPolyTime ea eb f)

/--
The class P is the set of decision problems
decidable in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine.
-/
def P : ComplexityClass :=
  { L | IsComputableInPolyTime finEncodingListBool finEncodingBoolBool L }

/--
The class NP is the set of decision problems
such that there exists a polynomial `p` over ℕ and a poly-time Turing machine
where for all `x`, `L x = true` iff there exists a `w` of length at most `p (|x|)`
such that the Turing machine accepts the pair `(x,w)`.

See Definition 2.1 in Arora-Barak (2009).
-/
def NP : ComplexityClass :=
  { L | ∃ (p : Polynomial ℕ), ∃ R : (List Bool × List Bool) → Bool,
      IsComputableInPolyTime finEncodingListBoolProdListBool finEncodingBoolBool R ∧
      ∀ x, L x ↔ ∃ w : List Bool, w.length ≤ p.eval x.length ∧ R (x, w) }

/--
The class coNP is the set of decision problems
whose complements are in NP.
-/
def coNP : ComplexityClass :=
  { L | Lᶜ ∈ NP }

/--
**P ≠ NP**:

The conjecture that the complexity classes P and NP are not equal.

theorem P_ne_NP : P ≠ NP := by sorry

/--
**NP ≠ coNP**:

The conjecture that the complexity classes NP and coNP are not equal.
-/
@[category research open, AMS 68]
theorem NP_ne_coNP : NP ≠ coNP := by sorry

/--
The theorem that the set of complements of languages in P is itself P.

This can be proven by observing that the boolean negation function is computable in polynomial time,
and that compositions of poly-time computable functions are also poly-time computable.
-/
@[category textbook, AMS 68]
theorem coP_eq_P :
    { L | Lᶜ ∈ P } = P := by
  sorry

/--
The theorem that P is a subset of NP.

This can be proven by observing that for any language in P,
we can construct a verifier that ignores the witness and simply runs the poly-time decider for the
language.

theorem P_subset_NP :
    P ⊆ NP := by

/--
The theorem that P is a subset of coNP.

    P ⊆ coNP := by
  rw [coNP, ← coP_eq_P]
