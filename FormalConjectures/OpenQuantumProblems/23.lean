# Open Quantum Problem 23: SIC-POVMs

## Mathematical problem
The OQP page presents three increasingly strong formulations of this problem.
In this file we formalize the first one, closest to the physics terminology:
existence of a symmetric informationally complete POVM in every finite dimension.

A SIC-POVM in dimension $d$ can be represented by a family of $d^2$ normalized
vectors in $\mathbb{C}^d$ whose pairwise squared overlaps are all equal to
$(d + 1)^{-1}$. We encode such a family as a map `Fin (d ^ 2) → StateVector d`.

## Background
SIC-POVMs are a basic structure in finite-dimensional quantum information.
They are closely related to equiangular lines, tight frames, quantum state
reconstruction, and finite-dimensional measurement theory.
The open problem asks whether such families exist in every dimension.

## What this file formalizes
This file formalizes the existence problem for symmetric informationally complete
POVMs through the predicate `HasSICPOVM d`.

More precisely, it contains the following layers.

### Core API
The main definitions formalized in this file are:
- `StateVector d`: a state vector in `ℂ^d`;
- `mkStateVector`: constructor from coordinates in the computational basis;
- `IsNormalized ψ`: normalization predicate for a state vector;
- `overlapSq φ ψ`: squared magnitude of the inner-product overlap;
- `HasConstantOverlapSq c Φ`: constant pairwise squared-overlap condition;
- `sicOverlapSq d`: the SIC overlap value `(d + 1)⁻¹`;
- `IsSICFamily d Φ`: the predicate that a family of `d^2` vectors in `ℂ^d`
  is a SIC family;
- `HasSICPOVM d`: existence of a SIC family in dimension `d`.

In addition, the file includes explicit witness families and convenient
constructors used in the low-dimensional benchmark cases:
- `vec2`, `vec3`;
- `qubitSICFamily`;
- `hesseFamily`;
- `bb84Family`.

### Complete open conjecture
The main open theorem is:
- `sicPOVMs`, expressing the conjecture that for every `d ≥ 1`, there exists a
  SIC-POVM in dimension `d`.

### Special cases
The file also isolates several special cases:
- solved low-dimensional benchmark cases:
  `hasSICPOVM_zero`, `hasSICPOVM_one`, `hasSICPOVM_two`, `hasSICPOVM_three`;
- a negative benchmark result:
  `bb84Family_not_isSICFamily`, showing that the BB84 family in dimension `2`
  does not form a SIC family;
- selected open benchmark dimensions:
  `hasSICPOVM_56`, `hasSICPOVM_58`, `hasSICPOVM_59`, `hasSICPOVM_60`,
  `hasSICPOVM_64`, `hasSICPOVM_68`, `hasSICPOVM_69`, `hasSICPOVM_70`,
  `hasSICPOVM_71`, `hasSICPOVM_72`, `hasSICPOVM_75`.

### Test lemmas
The file includes the following test lemmas and benchmark-support statements:
- `hasConstantOverlapSq_singleton`;
- `sicOverlapSq_one`, `sicOverlapSq_two`, `sicOverlapSq_three`,
  `sicOverlapSq_pos`;
- `isSICFamily_singleton_iff`, `isSICFamily_one_of_normalized`;
- `qubitSICFamily_normalized`, `qubitSICFamily_pairwise`;
- `hesseFamily_normalized`, `hesseFamily_pairwise`;
- `bb84Family_normalized`.

At present, these `@[category test, AMS 15 47 81]` results are included with
placeholder proofs `by sorry`; they are intended to be proved in the next PR.
