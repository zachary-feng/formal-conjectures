Can a finite set of disjoint unit segments in a unit square be maximal?
Solved affirmatively by [Da85], who gave an explicit construction.

This was formalized in Lean by Alexeev using Aristotle and ChatGPT.

/-- Is there a region $R$ with a maximal set of disjoint unit line segments that is countably infinite?
Solved affirmatively by [Fo99], who gave an explicit construction.
