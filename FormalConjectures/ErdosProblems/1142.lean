/--
The property that $n > 2$ and $n - 2^k$ is prime for all $k \geq 1$ with $2^k < n$.

Following the OEIS [A039669](https://oeis.org/A039669) convention ("Numbers n > 2 such that ..."),
we require $n > 2$ to exclude the trivial cases $n \leq 2$, for which the primality condition
is vacuously satisfied.

  2 < n ∧ ∀ k, 0 < k → 2 ^ k < n → (n - 2 ^ k).Prime

/--
Are there infinitely many $n > 2$ such that $n - 2^k$ is prime for all $k \geq 1$ with $2^k < n$?

The only known such $n$ are $4, 7, 15, 21, 45, 75, 105$ (OEIS [A039669](https://oeis.org/A039669)).

Mientka and Weitzenkamp [MiWe69] proved that the only $n \leq 2^{44}$ such that $n > 2$ and
$n - 2^k$ is prime for all $k \geq 1$ with $2^k < n$ are $4, 7, 15, 21, 45, 75, 105$.
