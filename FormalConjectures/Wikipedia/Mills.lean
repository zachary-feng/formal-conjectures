# Mills' Theorem

There exists a real $A > 1$ such that
$\lfloor A^{3^n}\rfloor$ is prime for every positive integer $n$, where $\lfloor\cdot\rfloor$
denotes the floor function.

The least such $A$ is known as *Mills' constant*. It is irrational, and assuming the
Riemann hypothesis it is approximately $1.3063778838\ldots$.
