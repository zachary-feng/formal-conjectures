Does there exist $B \subset \mathbb{N}$ which is not an additive basis,
but is such that for every set $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ of Schnirelmann density $\alpha$
and every $N$ there exists $b \in B$ such that
$$
  \lvert (A \cup (A+b)) \cap \{1, \ldots, N\} \rvert \geq (\alpha + f(\alpha)) N
$$
where $f(\alpha) > 0$ for $0 < \alpha < 1$?

Note: here Erdős seems to use a slightly weaker notion of an additive basis (see [Er56] at the top
of page 135). In particular, for this problem, a set is an additive basis of order $k$ if every
natural number can be written as a sum of _at most_ $k$ elements of the set, rather than as a sum of
_precisely_ $k$ elements.

A positive [solution](https://github.com/spicylemonade/erdos-38) was given by GPT 5.5 Pro
(prompted by gebyjaff, cleanup by Liam Price); in fact a sparse random set $B$ has this property,
with $f(\alpha)\gg \alpha (1-\alpha)^2$.

theorem erdos_38 : answer(True) ↔
    ∃ B : Set ℕ, ¬ B.IsWeakAddBasis ∧ ∃ f : ℝ → ℝ, (∀ α, 0 < α → α < 1 → f α > 0) ∧
      ∀ (A : Set ℕ) (N : ℕ),
        let α := schnirelmannDensity A
        ∃ b ∈ B, (Ioc 0 N ∩ (A ∪ (A + {b}))).ncard ≥ (α + f α) * N := by
