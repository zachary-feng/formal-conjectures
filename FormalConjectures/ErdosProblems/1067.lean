A graph is infinitely edge-connected if to disconnect the graph requires deleting
infinitely many edges. In other words, removing any finite set of edges leaves
the graph connected.

  ∀ ⦃s : Set (Sym2 V)⦄, s.Finite → (G.deleteEdges s).Connected

/--
Does every graph with chromatic number $\aleph_1$ contain an infinitely connected subgraph with
chromatic number $\aleph_1$?

Komjáth [Ko13] proved that it is consistent that the answer is no. This was improved by
Soukup [So15], who constructed a counterexample using no extra set-theoretical assumptions. A
simpler elementary example was given by Bowler and Pitz [BoPi24].

This was formalized in Lean by Alexeev using Aristotle and Aleph Prover.

Thomassen [Th17] constructed a counterexample to the version which asks for infinite
edge-connectivity (that is, to disconnect the graph requires deleting infinitely many edges).
