Let $G$ be such that any subgraph on $k$ vertices has at most $2k-3$ edges.
Is it true that, if $H$ has $m$ edges and no isolated vertices, then $\hat{r}(G,H) \ll m$?

In other words: if $G$ is sparse (every induced subgraph on $k$ vertices has $≤ 2k-3$ edges),
is $G$ Ramsey size linear?

theorem erdos_566 : answer(sorry) ↔
    ∀ (p : ℕ) (G : SimpleGraph (Fin p)),
      -- G is sparse: every induced subgraph on k ≥ 2 vertices has ≤ 2k - 3 edges
      (∀ S : Finset (Fin p), 2 ≤ S.card → (G.induce S).edgeSet.ncard ≤ 2 * S.card - 3) →
      -- Then G is Ramsey size linear
      ∃ c > (0 : ℝ), ∀ (n : ℕ) (H : SimpleGraph (Fin n)) [DecidableRel H.Adj],
