# Ringel's Conjecture

*Reference:* G. Ringel, *Problem 25*, in *Theory of Graphs and its Applications*
(Proc. Sympos. Smolenice, 1963), Academia, Prague, 1964.

Ringel's conjecture (1963): the complete graph $K_{2n+1}$ decomposes into copies of any tree
with $n$ edges. It remains open; the case of all sufficiently large $n$ is proved by
Montgomery–Pokrovskiy–Sudakov, see `Arxiv/2001.02665/RingelConjecture.lean`.

For any tree $T$ with $n$ edges, the complete graph $K_{2n+1}$ decomposes into
$2n+1$ edge-disjoint copies of $T$.

A "copy" of $T$ is the image $T.\text{map}(f_i)$ of $T$ under a vertex embedding
$f_i : V \hookrightarrow \text{Fin}(2n+1)$; the copies are pairwise edge-disjoint
and together cover every edge of $K_{2n+1}$.
