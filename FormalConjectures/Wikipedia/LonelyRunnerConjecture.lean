# Lonely runner conjecture

/--
Consider $n$ runners on a circular track of unit length. At the initial time
$t = 0$, all runners are at the same position and start to run; the runners'
speeds are constant, all distinct, and may be negative. A runner is said to be
lonely at time $t$ if they are at a distance (measured along the circle) of at
least $\frac 1 n$ from every other runner. The lonely runner conjecture states that each
runner is lonely at some time, no matter the choice of speeds.

For an $n$-tuple of distinct integer velocities $v_1,\dots,v_n$,
`deltaTuple v` is the maximal value of $\min_i \|t v_i\|_{\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}}$ over time.

The $n$th *gap of loneliness* $\delta_n$: the infimum of `deltaTuple`
over all $n$-tuples of distinct nonzero integer velocities.

**Theorem 1.3 (Tao, 2017; arXiv:1701.02048).**
There exists an absolute constant $c > 0$ such that for all sufficiently large $n$,
the gap of loneliness satisfies
$\delta_n \ge \frac{1}{2n} + \frac{c \log n}{n^2 (\log \log n)^2}$.
