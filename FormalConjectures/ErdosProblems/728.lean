Let $\varepsilon$ be sufficiently small and $C, C' > 0$. Are there integers $a, b, n$ such that
$$a, b > \varepsilon n\quad a!\, b! \mid n!\, (a + b - n)!, $$
and
$$C \log n < a + b - n < C' \log n ?$$

Note that the website currently displays a simpler (trivial) version of this problem because
$a + b$ isn't assumed to be in the $n + O(\log n)$ regime.

Barreto and ChatGPT-5.2 have proved that, for any $0 < C_1 < C_2$, there are infinitely many
$a, b, n$ with $b = n/2$, $a = n/2 + O(\log n)$, and $C_1 \log n < a + b - n < C_2 \log n$ such
that $a! b! \mid n! (a + b - n)!$

This appears to answer the question in the spirit it was intended.

This was formalized in Lean by Alexeev using Aristotle.
