# Erdős Problem 845

Let $C > 0$. Is it true that the set of integers of the form $n = b_1 + \cdots + b_t$,
with $b_1 < \cdots < b_t$, where $b_i = 2^{k_i}3^{l_i}$ for $1 \leq i\leq t$ and
$b_t \leq Cb_1$ has density $0$?

van Doorn and Everts \cite{vDEv25} have disproved this with $C=6$ - in fact, they prove that all
integers can be written as such a sum in which $b_t<6b_1$.

This was formalized in Lean by Alexeev using Aristotle.
