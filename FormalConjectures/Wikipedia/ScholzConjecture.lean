/-- An *addition chain* is a strictly increasing sequence
$1 = a_0 < a_1 < \cdots < a_r$ in which every entry after the first is the sum of two
(not necessarily distinct) earlier entries.

`IsAdditionChain c` asserts that the list $c$ is such a chain: it starts at $1$, is
strictly increasing, and every entry other than $1$ is a sum of two entries of $c$. -/
def IsAdditionChain (c : List ℕ) : Prop :=
  c.head? = some 1 ∧
  c.Pairwise (· < ·) ∧
  ∀ x ∈ c, x ≠ 1 → ∃ y ∈ c, ∃ z ∈ c, x = y + z

/-- The *length* $\ell(n)$ of $n$: the minimal number of addition steps (the number of
entries minus one) over all addition chains ending at $n$. -/
noncomputable def additionChainLength (n : ℕ) : ℕ :=
  sInf { r | ∃ c : List ℕ, IsAdditionChain c ∧ c.getLast? = some n ∧ c.length = r + 1 }

local notation "ℓ(" n ")" => additionChainLength n

/--
The Scholz conjecture, also known as the Scholz-Brauer conjecture, asserts that
for every positive integer $n$, the addition-chain length of $2^n - 1$ is at most
$n - 1 + \ell(n)$.
