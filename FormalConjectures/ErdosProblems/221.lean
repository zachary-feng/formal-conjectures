Is there a set $A\subset\mathbb{N}$ such that, for all large $N$,
$$\lvert A\cap\{1,\ldots,N\}\rvert \ll N/\log N$$
and such that every large integer can be written as $2^k+a$ for some
$k\geq 0$ and $a\in A$?

Lorentz [Lo54] proved there is such a set with, for all large $N$,
$$\lvert A\cap\{1,\ldots,N\}\rvert \ll \frac{\log\log N}{\log N}N$$
The answer is yes, proved by Ruzsa [Ru72].

theorem erdos_221 :
    answer(True) ↔ ∃ A : Set ℕ,
      ((fun N => ({a ∈ A | a ≤ N}.ncard : ℝ)) ≪ (fun N => (N : ℝ) / Real.log N)) ∧
      ∀ᶠ N in atTop, ∃ k a, 0 ≤ k ∧ a ∈ A ∧ N = 2 ^ k + a := by
