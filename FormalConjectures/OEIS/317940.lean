# Nonnegativity of the Dirichlet square root of A046644

A317940 is the integer sequence whose value `a n` is the numerator of the
rational sequence `f n`, where the Dirichlet convolution square of `f` is
A046644. The auxiliary sequence A046644 is multiplicative and takes the value
$2^{\operatorname{A005187}(e)}$ on a prime power $p^e$.

The conjecture asks whether `f n` is nonnegative for every positive `n`.
The proof reduces the problem to prime powers and constructs positive rational
coefficients $c(e)$ satisfying

$$\sum_{i=0}^e c(i)c(e-i)=2^{\operatorname{A005187}(e)}.$$

The coefficients are obtained from formal power series. A positive series
$A$ is defined by the first-order differential equation
$A' = \frac12 D A$. A second explicitly defined series $B$ satisfies
$B' = D B$ and has the same constant term as $A^2$; uniqueness of the
coefficient recurrence therefore gives $A^2=B$. After rescaling the
coefficients by $4^e$, this becomes the displayed prime-power convolution
identity.

Extending $c(e)$ multiplicatively over prime factorizations gives a positive
arithmetic function `root` with `root * root = a046644`. Finally, the recursive
definition of `f` is shown to be the unique Dirichlet square root with value
one at $1$, so `f = root` and every positive-index value of `f` is positive.

This route was found by first exploiting the multiplicativity recorded in the
OEIS entry, reducing the recurrence to the exponent of a single prime, and
then recognizing the resulting coefficient identities as a formal-power-series
differential equation.

"No negative terms among the first 2^20 terms. Is the sequence nonnegative?"

Equivalently, the rational Dirichlet square root `f` is nonnegative at every
positive index. Informally, the proof constructs a strictly positive
multiplicative square root prime-power by prime-power using formal power
series, and then identifies it with the recursively defined sequence `f`.

The proof was obtained by exploiting the multiplicativity of A046644 and
reducing the problem to its values on prime powers. The resulting convolution
recurrence for the prime-power coefficients was recognized as a
formal-power-series identity. A positive coefficient sequence was constructed
through a differential equation for the generating series, extended
multiplicatively to all positive integers, and finally identified with the
recursively defined Dirichlet square root by uniqueness.
