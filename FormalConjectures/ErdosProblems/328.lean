Suppose $A\subseteq\mathbb{N}$ and $C>0$ is such that $1_A\ast 1_A(n)\leq C$ for all
$n\in\mathbb{N}$. Can $A$ be partitioned into $t$ many subsets $A_1,\ldots,A_t$ (where
$t=t(C)$ depends only on $C$) such that $1_{A_i}\ast 1_{A_i}(n)<C$ for all $1\leq i\leq t$
and $n\in \mathbb{N}$?

The answer is no. Asked by Erdős and Newman. Nešetřil and Rödl [NeRo85] have shown the
answer is no for all $C$ (even if $t$ is also allowed to depend on $A$).

Erdős [Er80e] had previously shown the answer is no for $C=3,4$ and infinitely many other
values of $C$.
