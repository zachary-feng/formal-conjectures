The condition that an integer `m` ensures the existence of a function `f` covering `Fin n`
for all large enough subsets `Y`.
The property is invariant under bijection, so we use a representative `Fin n` for a finite set
of size `n`.

Let $H(n)$ be the minimum integer $m$ such that there is a function $f: \mathcal{P}(X) \to X$
where $X$ is a finite set of size $n$, such that for every subset $Y \subseteq X$ with $|Y| \ge m$,
the set $\{f(A) : A \subseteq Y\}$ covers $X$.

/--
Let $X$ be a finite set of size $n$ and $H(n)$ be such that there is a function
$f:\{A : A\subseteq X\}\to X$ so that for every $Y\subseteq X$ with $\lvert Y\rvert \geq H(n)$
we have $\left\{ f(A) : A\subseteq Y\right\}=X$.
Prove that $H(n)-\log_2 n \to \infty$.
