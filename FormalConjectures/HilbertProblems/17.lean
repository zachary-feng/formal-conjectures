# Hilbert's 17th problem

Let $f(x_1, \dots, x_n)$ be a multivariable polynomial with real coefficients that takes only
nonnegative values for all real inputs.
Hilbert's 17th problem asks whether there exist rational functions $g_1, \dots, g_m$ such that
$f = g_1^2 + g_2^2 + \cdots + g_m^2$. Resolved affirmatively by Artin in 1927.

The statement is false in general if we restrict to polynomials. The polynomial (by Motzkin)
$f(x, y) = x^4 y^2 + x^2 y^4 - 3 x^2 y^2 + 1$ takes only nonnegative values but cannot be
written as a sum of squares of polynomials.

For the polynomial version, Hilbert showed that every nonnegative homogeneous polynomial in
$n$ variables of degree $2d$ can be written as a sum of squares of polynomials if and only if
- $n = 1$
- $n = 2$
- $d = 1$
- $(n, d) = (3, 2)$.
