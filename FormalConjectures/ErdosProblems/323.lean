Let $1\leq m\leq k$ and $f_{k,m}(x)$ denote the number of integers $\leq x$ which are the sum of
$m$ many nonnegative $k$th powers.

noncomputable def f (k m x : ℕ) : ℕ :=
  { n : ℕ | n ≤ x ∧ ∃ (v : Fin m → ℕ), n = ∑ i, v i ^ k }.ncard

/--
Is it true that $f_{k,k}(x) \gg_\epsilon x^{1-\epsilon}$ for all $\epsilon>0$?

This would have significant applications to Waring's problem. Erdős and Graham describe this as
'unattackable by the methods at our disposal'.

Is it true that if $m < k$ then $f_{k,m}(x) \gg x^{m/k}$ for sufficiently large $x$?

The case $k=2$ was resolved by Landau, who showed $f_{2,2}(x) \sim \frac{cx}{\sqrt{\log x}}$ for
some constant $c>0$.

For $k>2$ it is not known if $f_{k,k}(x)=o(x)$.
