# Erdős Problem 567

Let $G$ be either $Q_3$ or $K_{3,3}$ or $H_5$ (the last formed by adding two vertex-disjoint chords
to $C_5$). Is it true that, if $H$ has $m$ edges and no isolated vertices, then
$$ \hat{r}(G,H) \ll m? $$

In other words, is $G$ Ramsey size linear? A special case of Problem 566.
