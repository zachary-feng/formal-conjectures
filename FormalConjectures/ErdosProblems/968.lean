# Erdős Problem 968

Let `uₙ = pₙ / n`, where `pₙ` is the `n`th prime. Does the set of `n` such that `uₙ < uₙ₊₁`
have positive density?

Erdős and Prachar also proved that `∑_{pₙ < x} |uₙ₊₁ - uₙ| ≍ (log x)^2`, and that the set of `n`
such that `uₙ > uₙ₊₁` has positive density. Erdős also asked whether there are infinitely many
increasing triples `uₙ < uₙ₊₁ < uₙ₊₂` or decreasing triples `uₙ > uₙ₊₁ > uₙ₊₂`.

`u n` is the normalized `n`th prime, defined as `pₙ / (n+1)` where `pₙ` is the `n`th prime
(with `0.nth Nat.Prime = 2`).

This corresponds to the classical sequence `(p₁/1, p₂/2, p₃/3, ...)` while using `Nat.nth Prime`'s
`0`-based indexing; in particular, the denominator is always positive.

Erdős and Prachar proved `∑_{pₙ < x} |u (n+1) - u n| ≍ (log x)^2` (see [ErPr61]).

We encode `∑_{pₙ < x}` as a sum over `n < Nat.primeCounting' x` (the number of primes `< x`).
