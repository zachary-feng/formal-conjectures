# Erdős Problem 15: Convergence of Series with Primes

Is it true that $\sum_{n=1}^\infty(-1)^n\frac{n}{p_n}$ converges,
where $p_n$ is the sequence of primes?

Note: In the problem statement, $p_n$ is the $n$-th prime, indexed such that $p_1=2, p_2=3, \ldots$.
We 0-index here to reflect how Nat.nth works.
