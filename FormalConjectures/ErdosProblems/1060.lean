/-- The conjecture is about the function $f(n)$ which counts the number of solutions to
$k\sigma(k)=n$, where $\sigma(k)$ is the sum of divisors of $k$. The first bound is that $f(n)$ grows slower
than any power of $n^(\frac{1}{\log\log n})$. The second bound is that $f(n)$ is at most a power of
$\log n$.
