# Erdős Problem 413

Erdős called a natural number `n` a *barrier* for `ω`, the number of distinct prime divisors,
if `m + ω(m) ≤ n` for all `m < n`. He believed there should be infinitely many such barriers, and
even posed a relaxed variant asking whether there is some `ε > 0` for which infinitely many `n`
satisfy `m + ε · ω(m) ≤ n` for every `m < n`.
