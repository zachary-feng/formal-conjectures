theorem green_4 (n : ℕ) :
    let S : ∀ n, Set (alternatingGroup <| Fin n) := answer(sorry)
    MaximalFor (ProdFree (M := alternatingGroup <| Fin n)) Set.ncard (S n) := by
  sorry

/-- Defines a family of subsets of $A_n$ where each permutation $\pi$ in a subset obeys $\pi(x)$
and $\forall v \in I$, \pi(v)\notin I$ for a fixed $x$ and $I$. It is easy to demonstrate that such
a subset is product-free, because for any a,b,c in such a set, $(a*b) (x)=a(b(x))\notin I$ but $c(x)
in I$

def extremalFamily {n : ℕ} (x : Fin n) (I : Set (Fin n)) : Set <| alternatingGroup <| Fin n :=
  {π | π.val x ∈ I ∧ Disjoint (I.image π) I}

/-- In the case of large n, the problem was solved in
[On the largest product-free subsets of the alternating groups](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.15191).
Specifically, this theorem formalizes the statement of theorem 1.1 in the mentioned paper
