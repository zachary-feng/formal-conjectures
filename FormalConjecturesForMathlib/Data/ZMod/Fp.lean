# Notation for finite field vector spaces

This file defines the notation `𝔽 p n` for the vector space `Fin n → ZMod p`
over the finite field of order `p`, and provides standard abbreviations for
small primes.
-/

/-- `𝔽 p n` is the vector space `(Z/pZ)^n`. When `p` is prime, this is $\mathbb{F}_p^n$. -/
abbrev 𝔽 (p n : ℕ) := Fin n → ZMod p

/-- `𝔽₂ n` is the vector space $\mathbb{F}_2^n$. -/
abbrev 𝔽₂ (n : ℕ) := 𝔽 2 n

/-- `𝔽₃ n` is the vector space $\mathbb{F}_3^n$. -/
abbrev 𝔽₃ (n : ℕ) := 𝔽 3 n

/-- `𝔽₅ n` is the vector space $\mathbb{F}_5^n$. -/
abbrev 𝔽₅ (n : ℕ) := 𝔽 5 n

/-- `𝔽₇ n` is the vector space $\mathbb{F}_7^n$. -/
abbrev 𝔽₇ (n : ℕ) := 𝔽 7 n
