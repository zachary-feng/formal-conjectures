# The Catch-Up game and conjecture

The game **Catch-Up** (Isaksen–Ismail–Brams–Nealen, 2015) is a two-player, perfect-information game
played on a finite nonempty set `S` of positive integers. Each time a player removes a number from
`S`, that number is added to the player’s score.

**Rules.**
* The scores start at `0`. Player `p1` starts by removing **exactly one** number from `S`.
* After the first move, players alternate turns. On a turn, the current player removes **one or more**
  numbers from `S`, one at a time, and must keep removing numbers until their score becomes
  **at least** the opponent’s score; before the final pick they must remain **strictly behind**.
* If the current player cannot catch up (in particular, even taking all remaining numbers would still
  leave them behind), the game ends immediately: the current player receives all remaining numbers.

When `S` is empty, the player with higher score wins; equal scores give a draw.

In this file we define:
* `Player` and `Outcome`,
* the recursive evaluator `value` (optimal play),
* the conjecture `value_of_even_mul_succ_self_div_two`.

## Example
For `S = {1,2,3,4}` one play is: `p1` takes `2`, `p2` takes `1` then `4`, and `p1` takes `3`,
ending with scores `(5,5)`.

`value remaining s_me s_opp isFirstMove` evaluates the position where:

* `remaining` is the set `S'` of numbers not yet taken.
* `s_me` is the current score of the player who is about to act (the “current player”).
* `s_opp` is the opponent’s current score.
* `isFirstMove` indicates whether we are in the special very first move of the whole game,
  where the rules force exactly one pick and then the turn passes.

The result is the game-theoretic value from the current player’s point of view:
`.win` / `.loss` / `.draw`, assuming optimal play from both sides.

We model a single *turn* (which may consist of several picks `$x_1,...,x_k$`) by recursion:
the current player chooses one number `x`; if they are still strictly behind after taking it, they must
continue the same turn (so the recursive call keeps the same “current player”);
once they catch up (score ≥ opponent), the turn ends and we swap players.
