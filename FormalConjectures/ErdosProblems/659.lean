Is there a set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ such that every subset of $4$ points determines at
least $3$ distances, yet the total number of distinct distances is $\ll \frac{n}{\sqrt{\log n}}$?

There does exist such a set: a suitable truncation of the lattice
$\{(a,b\sqrt{2}): a,b\in\mathbb{Z}\}$ suffices. This construction appears to have been first
considered by Moree and Osburn \cite{MoOs06}, who proved that it has
 $\ll \frac{n}{\sqrt{\log n}}$ many distinct distances. This construction was independently found by
 [Lund and Sheffer](https://adamsheffer.wordpress.com/2014/07/16/point-sets-with-few-distinct-distances/),
 who further noted that this configuration contains no squares or equilateral triangles.

There are only six possible configurations of $4$ points which determine only $2$ distances
(first noted by Erdős and Fishburn [ErFi96]), and five of them contain either a square or an
equilateral triangle. The remaining configuration contains four points from a regular pentagon,
and Grayzel [Gr26] (using Gemini) has noted in the comments that this configuration can also be
ruled out, thus giving a complete solution to this problem.

Boris Alexeev provides a formalisation of the reduction, which is conditional on Bernays' theorem
(assumed as an axiom in the proof to obtain the $O(n/\sqrt{\log n})$ bound).
