WOWII [Conjecture 13](http://cms.dt.uh.edu/faculty/delavinae/research/wowII/)

For a simple connected graph `G`, the size `b(G)` of a largest induced bipartite subgraph
satisfies `b(G) ≥ diam(G) + max_{v ∈ V} l(v) - 1`, where `diam(G)` is the diameter
of `G` and `l(v) = indepNeighborsCard G v` is the independence number of the
neighbourhood of `v`.

theorem conjecture13 (G : SimpleGraph α) (h : G.Connected) :
    letI maxL := (Finset.univ.image (fun v => indepNeighborsCard G v)).max' (by simp)
    (G.diam : ℝ) + (maxL : ℝ) - 1 ≤ b G := by

-- Sanity checks

/-- The largest induced bipartite subgraph invariant `b G` is nonneg for any graph. -/

example (G : SimpleGraph (Fin 3)) : 0 ≤ b G := Nat.cast_nonneg _

/-- In `K₂`, all vertices have degree 1, so `indepNeighborsCard` at vertex 0 is 0
(the neighbourhood of 0 consists of only vertex 1, which has no independent edges). -/
