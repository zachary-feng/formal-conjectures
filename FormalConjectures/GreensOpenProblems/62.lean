# Ben Green's Open Problem 62

Let $p$ be a large prime, and let $A$ be the set of all primes less than $p$.
Is every $x \in \{1, \ldots, p-1\}$ congruent to some product $a_1 a_2$ where $a_1, a_2 \in A$?

This is a problem of Erdős, Odlyzko, and Sárközy [105] from 1987.

theorem green_62 :
    answer(sorry) ↔
      ∀ᶠ p in atTop, p.Prime →
        let A := (Finset.range p).filter Nat.Prime
        ∀ x : ℕ, 1 ≤ x ∧ x < p →
          ∃ a₁ ∈ A, ∃ a₂ ∈ A, (x : ZMod p) = (a₁ * a₂ : ZMod p) := by
  sorry
