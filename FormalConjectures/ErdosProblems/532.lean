If $\mathbb{N}$ is 2-coloured then is there some infinite set $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ such that
all finite subset sums$$ \sum_{n\in S}n$$(as $S$ ranges over all non-empty finite subsets of $A$)
are monochromatic?

Asked by Graham and Rothschild. Proved by Hindman [Hi74] (for any number of colours).
