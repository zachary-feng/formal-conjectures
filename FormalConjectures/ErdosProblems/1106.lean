/-- The partition function p(n) is the number of ways to write n as a sum of positive
integers (where the order of the summands does not matter). -/
def p : ℕ → ℕ := fun n => Fintype.card (Nat.Partition n)

/--
Let $p(n)$ be the partition number of $n$ and $F(n)$ be the number of distinct prime factors of
$∏_{i= 1} ^ {n} p(n)$, then $F(n)$ tends to infinity when $n$ tends to infinity.

/--
Let $p(n)$ be the partition number of $n$ and $F(n)$ be the number of distinct prime factors of
$∏_{i= 1} ^ {n} p(n)$, $F(n)>n$ for sufficiently large $n$.
