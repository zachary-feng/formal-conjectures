/-- The number of countable models of some L-Theory T up to isomorphism -/
def numberOfCountableModels {L : FirstOrder.Language} (T : L.Theory) : Cardinal :=

/--
The Vaught conjecture states that for a countable language L and a complete L-Theory T
the number of countable models of T (up to isomorphism) is finite, $\aleph_0$ or $2^{\aleph_0}$.
