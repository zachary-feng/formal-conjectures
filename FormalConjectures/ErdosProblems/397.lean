Are there only finitely many solutions to
$$
  \prod_i \binom{2m_i}{m_i}=\prod_j \binom{2n_j}{n_j}
$$
with the $m_i,n_j$ distinct?

Somani, using ChatGPT, has given a negative answer. In fact, for any $a\geq 2$, if $c=8a^2+8a+1$,
$\binom{2a}{a}\binom{4a+4}{2a+2}\binom{2c}{c}= \binom{2a+2}{a+1}\binom{4a}{2a}\binom{2c+2}{c+1}.$
Further families of solutions are given in the comments by SharkyKesa.

This was earlier asked about in a [MathOverflow] question, in response to which Elkies also gave an
alternative construction which produces solutions - at the moment it is not clear whether Elkies'
argument gives infinitely many solutions (although Bloom believes that it can).

This was formalized in Lean by Wu using Aristotle.
