# Erdős Problem 740: Infinitary version of chromatic number and odd cycles

def NoShortOddCycle {V : Type*} (G : SimpleGraph V) (r : ℕ) : Prop :=
  ∀ (v : V) (c : G.Walk v v), c.IsCycle → Odd c.length → c.length > r

/--
Let $\mathfrak{m}$ be an infinite cardinal and $G$ be a graph with chromatic number $\mathfrak{m}$.
Let $r\geq 1$. Must $G$ contain a subgraph of chromatic number $\mathfrak{m}$ which does not contain
any odd cycle of length $\leq r$?
