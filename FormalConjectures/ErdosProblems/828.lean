Is it true that, for any $a \in \mathbb{Z}$, there are infinitely many $n$ such that
$$\phi(n) | n + a$$?

/--
When $n > 1$, Lehmer conjectured that $\phi(n) | n - 1$ if and only if $n$ is prime.

/--
It is an easy exercise to show that $\phi(n) | n$ if and only if $n = 0, 1$ or $n = 2^a 3^b$ for
some $a > 0$.
