# Steiner Systems

A Steiner system $S(t, k, n)$ is a collection of $k$-element subsets (called blocks) of
an $n$-element set such that every $t$-element subset is contained in exactly one block.

An $S(t, k, n)$-Steiner system is a collection of $k$-element subsets (called blocks) of
$\{0, \ldots, n-1\}$ such that every $t$-element subset is contained in exactly one block.

This is the standard notation from combinatorics, where:
- $n$ is the number of points
- $k$ is the block size
- $t$ is the covering parameter (every $t$-subset is in exactly one block)
-/
structure SteinerSystem (t k n : ℕ) where
  /-- The blocks of the Steiner system. -/
  blocks : Finset (Finset (Fin n))
  /-- Every block has exactly $k$ elements. -/
  block_card : ∀ B ∈ blocks, B.card = k
  /-- Every $t$-element subset is contained in exactly one block.
  Note: We use `.filter.card = 1` instead of `∃!` because `∃! B ∈ blocks, R ⊆ B` desugars to
  a quantifier over all `Finset (Fin n)`, which loses `Decidable` and breaks `native_decide`. -/
  cover_unique : ∀ R : Finset (Fin n), R.card = t → (blocks.filter (R ⊆ ·)).card = 1

/-- Notation for Steiner systems: `S(t, k, n)` denotes a Steiner system with
covering parameter `t`, block size `k`, and `n` points. -/

Construct an $S(t, k, n)$-Steiner system with $n > k > t > 5$, $t < 10$, and $n < 200$.

No example of a Steiner system with $t > 5$ is known, despite a 2014 existence theorem
by Keevash showing that such systems must exist for sufficiently large $n$.

Sanity check: the Fano plane is an $S(2, 3, 7)$-Steiner system.

The Fano plane consists of $7$ blocks of size $3$ over $7$ points,
where every pair of points is contained in exactly one block.

**Existence of $S(5, 6, 12)$**: The small Witt design.

There exists a unique Steiner system $S(5, 6, 12)$, known as the small Witt design.
It was constructed by Witt (1938) and is closely related to the Mathieu group $M_{12}$.
This is one of only two known Steiner systems with $t = 5$.

**There are infinitely many Steiner systems with $t = 4$.**

Keevash (2014) proved that for any fixed $t$ and $k$, a Steiner system $S(t, k, n)$
exists for all sufficiently large $n$ satisfying the necessary divisibility conditions.
Since there are infinitely many such admissible $n$, this implies infinitely many
$S(4, k, n)$ systems exist (for any fixed $k > 4$). The proof is nonconstructive.

Explicit examples include $S(4, 5, 11)$ (the unique system, related to the Mathieu
group $M_{11}$) and $S(4, 7, 23)$ (related to the Mathieu group $M_{23}$).

**There are infinitely many Steiner systems with $t = 5$.**

Keevash (2014) proved that for any fixed $t$ and $k$, a Steiner system $S(t, k, n)$
exists for all sufficiently large $n$ satisfying the necessary divisibility conditions.
This settles the long-standing open problem of whether infinitely many $S(5, k, n)$
systems exist. The proof is nonconstructive.

Only two explicit examples are known: $S(5, 6, 12)$ and $S(5, 8, 24)$, both Witt
designs related to the Mathieu groups $M_{12}$ and $M_{24}$ respectively.
No Steiner system with $t \geq 6$ has been explicitly constructed, though Keevash's
result guarantees their existence nonconstructively as well.
