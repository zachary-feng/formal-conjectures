Let $A=\{a_1 < \cdots < a_k\}$ be a finite set of integers and extend it to an infinite
sequence $\overline{A}=\{a_1 < a_2 < \cdots \}$ by defining $a_{n+1}$ for $n \geq k$ to be
the least integer exceeding $a_n$ which is not of the form $a_i + a_j$ with $i,j \leq n$.
Is it true that the sequence of differences $a_{m+1}-a_m$ is eventually periodic?

This problem is discussed under Problem 7 on Green's open problems list.
