# The Bing-Borsuk Conjecture

The Bing-Borsuk conjecture states that every $n$-dimensional homogeneous absolute neighborhood
retract is a topological $n$-manifold.

The conjecture has been verified in dimensions $1$ and $2$ but remains open in higher dimensions.
A notable consequence is that if the $3$-dimensional case is true, it implies the Poincaré
conjecture.

The Bing-Borsuk Conjecture: every $n$-dimensional homogeneous absolute neighborhood retract
is a topological $n$-manifold. A topological space $X$ is an $n$-dimensional manifold
when `T2Space X ∧ Nonempty (ChartedSpace (Fin n → ℝ) X)`. The hypothesis `[MetrizableSpace X]`
implies `T2Space X` so this does not appear in the conclusion.
