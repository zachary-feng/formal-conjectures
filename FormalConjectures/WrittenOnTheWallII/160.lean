# Written on the Wall II - Conjecture 160

*Reference:*
[E. DeLaVina, Written on the Wall II, Conjectures of Graffiti.pc](http://cms.dt.uh.edu/faculty/delavinae/research/wowII/)

## Definitions

For a vertex $v$ in $G$, **$T(v)$** is the number of triangles incident to $v$:
$$T(v) = |\{\{u, w\} \subseteq N(v) \mid u \sim w\}|$$
i.e., the number of pairs of neighbors of $v$ that are themselves adjacent.

The invariant `maxTrianglesAtVertex G` is the maximum of $T(v)$ over all vertices.

Conjecture 160 uses both $\max_v T(v)$ and $\chi_{C_4}(G)$, the $C_4$-free
characteristic function: it is `1` when $G$ contains no cycle of length four
and `0` otherwise. The cycle need not be induced. These invariants lower-bound
the WOWII invariant $L_s(G)$, the maximum number of leaves over all spanning
trees of $G$ (exposed as `SimpleGraph.Ls G : ℝ`).

The earlier formalization used the number of induced four-cycles. The historical
conjecture instead uses this binary $C_4$-free indicator.

WOWII [Conjecture 160](http://cms.dt.uh.edu/faculty/delavinae/research/wowII/)

For a simple connected graph $G$,
$L_s(G) \ge \max_v l(v) + \max_v T(v) \cdot \chi_{C_4}(G)$
where:

- $L_s(G) = \mathrm{SimpleGraph.Ls}\, G$ is the maximum number of leaves over all
  spanning trees of $G$,
- $\max_v l(v)$ is the maximum local independence number over vertices,
- $\max_v T(v)$ is the maximum number of triangles incident to any vertex,
- $\chi_{C_4}(G)$ is `1` if $G$ has no cycle of length four and `0` otherwise.
