Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a family of sets closed under taking subsets (i.e. if
$B\subseteq A\in\mathcal{F}$ then $B\in \mathcal{F}$). There exists some element $x$ such that
whenever $\mathcal{F}'\subseteq \mathcal{F}$ is an intersecting subfamily we have
$$\lvert \mathcal{F}'\rvert \leq \lvert \{ A\in \mathcal{F} : x\in A\}\rvert.$$
