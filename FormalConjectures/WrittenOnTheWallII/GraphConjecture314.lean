/-- The size of a largest induced path of $G$, as a natural number.

A subset $s \subseteq V(G)$ is an *induced path* when the induced subgraph
`G.induce s` is a tree in which every vertex has degree at most $2$
(equivalently: a tree that is itself a path graph). We define
`largestInducedPathSize G` as the supremum of `s.card` over all such subsets.

**Disambiguation.** This is *not* the `SimpleGraph.path` invariant, which is the
floor of the average distance — that one is the wrong tool for WOWII Conjecture
314, where $\mathrm{path}(G)$ denotes the **size of a largest induced path**.

TODO: it would probably be clearer to rename the `SimpleGraph.path` invariant to
something like `pathBound` / `floorAvgDist` to avoid this naming collision. -/

WOWII [Conjecture 314](http://cms.uhd.edu/faculty/delavinae/research/wowII/all.html#conj314):

For every finite simple connected graph $G$ with $n > 1$ vertices,
if $G$ is triangle-free and $\mathrm{path}(G) \le 4$, then $G$ is well totally
dominated.

Here $\mathrm{path}(G) = \mathrm{largestInducedPathSize}\, G$ is the **size of a
largest induced path** in $G$, defined locally above.

**Disambiguation.** Earlier revisions of this file used the `SimpleGraph.path`
invariant, but that is the *floor of the average distance*, not the size of a
largest induced path — a different quantity that makes Conjecture 314 vacuous
in many cases.
