# Ben Green's Open Problem 50

Suppose that $A \subset \mathbb{F}_2^n$ is a set of density $\alpha$. Does $10A$ contain a coset
of some subspace of dimension at least $n - O(\log(1/\alpha))$?

Here $kA$ denotes the $k$-fold iterated sumset, i.e., the set of all sums of $k$ elements from $A$
(with repetition allowed). In `Mathlib`, this is denoted `k • A` using pointwise scalar
multiplication on sets.

Let $A \subset \mathbb{F}_2^n$ be a set of density $\alpha > 0$. Does $10A$ contain a coset
of some subspace of dimension at least $n - O(\log(1/\alpha))$?

More precisely: does there exist an absolute constant $C > 0$ such that for all $n \geq 1$ and all
nonempty $A \subseteq \mathbb{F}_2^n$ with density $\alpha > 0$, the sumset $10A$ contains a coset
of some subspace of dimension at least $n - C \log_2(1/\alpha)$?

The sumset $10A$ is defined as $\{a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_{10} : a_i \in A\}$, using the pointwise
scalar multiplication notation `10 • A` where `•` denotes the iterated addition of a set.

Note: We model $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ as `Fin n → ZMod 2`, which is an $n$-dimensional vector space
over $\mathbb{F}_2$.
