sums of distinct factorials.

A number is powerful if each prime factor appears with exponent at least 2.

  ∀ p : ℕ, p.Prime → p ∣ n → p ^ 2 ∣ n

For each $k \geq 2$, does the set $A = \left\{ \sum_{n\in S}n! : S\subset \mathbb{N}\text{ finite}\right\}$ of all finite sums of distinct factorials contain only finitely many $k$-th powers?
