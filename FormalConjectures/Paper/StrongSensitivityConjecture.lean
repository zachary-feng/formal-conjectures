# Strong Sensitivity Conjecture (`bs(f) ≤ s(f)^2`)

This file formalizes the *strong* sensitivity conjecture, asserting:

For every Boolean function `f : {0,1}^n → {0,1}`,
`bs(f) ≤ s(f)^2`,
where bs(f) denotes block sensitivity and s(f) denotes sensitivity.

Huang's theorem proves a *quartic* upper bound, `bs(f) ≤ s(f)^4`, thereby
resolving the most widely known form of the sensitivity conjecture.

We now ask whether a stronger upper bound holds. Interestingly, the original
paper of Nisan and Szegedy, where the sensitivity conjecture first appeared,
already speculated that a *quadratic* upper bound might be the correct
relation. On the lower bound side, Rubinstein
(https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01200762) constructed Boolean functions
exhibiting the first quadratic separation. The best currently
known gap, due to Ambainis and Sun (https://arxiv.org/abs/1108.3494), is
`bs(f) ≥ (2/3)⋅s(f)^2`.

`bs(f) ≤ s(f)^2`.

We call this the *strong* sensitivity conjecture because the original sensitivity
conjecture only asked for a polynomial bound in terms of `s(f)`. Huang's
celebrated result (often called the sensitivity theorem) gives a quartic bound,
`bs(f) ≤ s(f)^4`, thereby settling the original conjecture. -/

/-- Simple test example,
A Boolean function whose block sensitivity is strictly greater than
its sensitivity. Source: [Nisan1989](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/73007.73038).

`nisanExample(x) = 1` iff the Hamming weight of `x` is either
`n/2` or `n/2 + 1`. We assume `n` is a multiple of 4.
The function is symmetric, so its value only depends on the Hamming weight
of the input. -/
