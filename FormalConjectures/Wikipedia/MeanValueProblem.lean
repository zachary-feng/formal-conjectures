Given a complex polynomial $p$ of degree $d ≥ 2$ and a complex number $z$
there is a critical point $c$ of $p$, such that $|p(z)-p(c)|/|z-c| ≤ K* |p'(z)|$ for $K=1$.


The conjecture has been proven for:
* `K = 4`

* `K = (d-1)/d` if $p$ has real roots or all the roots of $p$ have the same norm.

The following weaker version of the mean value problem has been proven.
Given a complex polynomial $p$ of degree $d ≥ 2$ and a complex number $z$
there a critical point $c$ of $p$, such that $|p(z)-p(c)|/|z-c| ≤ 4|p'(z)|$.

The following tighter bound depending on the degree $d$ of the polynomial $p$,
in the case of $p$ only having real roots has been shown by Tischler.
$|p(z)-p(c)|/|z-c| \le (d-1)/d \cdot |p'(z)|$
