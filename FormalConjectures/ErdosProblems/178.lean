Let $A_1,A_2,\ldots$ be an infinite collection of infinite sets of integers, say
$A_i=\{a_{i1}<a_{i2}<\cdots\}$. Does there exist some $f:\mathbb{N}\to\{-1,1\}$ such that
$$\max_{m, 1\leq i\leq d} \left\lvert \sum_{1\leq j\leq m} f(a_{ij})\right\rvert \ll_d 1$$
for all $d\geq 1$?

Erdős remarks 'it seems certain that the answer is affirmative'. This was solved by Beck [Be81]. Recently Beck [Be17] proved that one can replace $\ll_d 1$ with $\ll d^{4+\epsilon}$ for any $\epsilon>0$.

theorem erdos_178 : answer(True) ↔
    ∀ (a : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ) (ha : ∀ i, StrictMono (a i)),
    ∃ f : ℕ → ℤ, (∀ n, f n = 1 ∨ f n = -1) ∧
