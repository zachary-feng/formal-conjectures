# Erdős Problem 486: Logarithmic density for sets avoiding modular subsets

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/486](https://www.erdosproblems.com/486)

namespace Erdos486

/--
For each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ choose some $X_n \subseteq \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$.
Let $B = \{m \in \mathbb{N} : \forall n, m \not\equiv x \pmod{n} \text{ for all } x \in X_n\}$.
Must $B$ have a logarithmic density?
