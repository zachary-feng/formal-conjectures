open Finset

/--
Let $G$ be an abelian group of size $N$, and suppose that $A \subset G$ has density $\alpha$.
Are there at least $\alpha^{15} N^{10}$ tuples $(x_1, \dots, x_5, y_1, \dots, y_5) \in G^{10}$
such that $x_i + y_j \in A$ whenever $j \in \{i, i+1, i+2\}$?

Note: We interpret indices modulo 5.
