# Conjecture relating two characterizations of a set of integers.

Informal Statement:
For an integer $k \ge 2$, the following are equivalent:

1. The greatest common divisor of the binomial coefficients
    $\binom{2k}{k}, \binom{3k}{k}, \dots, \binom{(k+1)k}{k} = 1$.

2. Writing prime factorization of $k$ as
    $k = \prod p_i^{e_i}$, and let
    $P = \max_i p_i^{e_i}$,
    one has $k / P > P$.

This conjecture asserts that the sequence defined by 1. is obtained by
taking 1 off each number in the sequence defined by 2.

Conjecture: The gcd condition is equivalent to the prime power condition.
This has been conjectured by Ralf Stephan.

Both the natural-language proof and its Lean 4 formalization were carried out
by the KLMM MechMath Agent Team; see the `formal_proof` attribute.
