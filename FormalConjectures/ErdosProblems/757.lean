/-- We say that `c` is admissible if for any finit set `A` such that for any subset `B` of size `4`,
`(B - B).card = 11`, there exists a Sidon subset `S` of size at least `c * A.ncard`. -/

  B.ncard = 4 → (B - B).ncard = 11) → ∃ S ⊆ A, IsSidon S ∧ c * A.ncard ≤ (S.ncard : ℝ)

/-- What is the supremum of the set of admissible numbers? -/

theorem erdos_757 {A : Set ℝ} :
    answer(sorry) = sSup {c | IsAdmissible c} := by

/-- The supremum is strictly larger than `1 / 2`, which is proved in [GyLe95]. -/

/-- In [GyLe95], the authors also prove that the supremum is smaller than `3 / 5`. -/
