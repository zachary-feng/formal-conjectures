# Sparse Ruler

A sparse ruler of length $L$ is a sequence of marks $0 = a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_m = L$.
A distance $k \in \mathbb{N}$ can be measured if there are $i, j \in \{1, \dots, m\}$, such that
$k = a_j - a_i$.

One question concerns the structure of *optimal* rulers. Wichmann [Wi63] gave a
parametric family of sparse rulers and conjectured that, beyond a small number of exceptions,
every optimal ruler is of his type. The known exceptions occur at lengths $1, 13, 17, 23, 58$;
the largest of these has $13$ segments, which motivates the bound below.

The asymptotic growth of the minimal number of marks of an optimal ruler of length $L$ — i.e.
the limit of $l(n)^2 / n$, conjectured to lie in $[2.434\ldots, 3]$ — is the subject of
`FormalConjectures.ErdosProblems.«170»` (there phrased via $F(N)/\sqrt{N}$), and is not
restated here.

/-- A ruler is described by its list of *segment lengths* (gaps) `g`, so that its marks are
the partial sums $0 = m_0 < m_1 < \cdots < m_n = L$, where $n$ (`g.length`) is the number of
segments and $L$ (`g.sum`) is the length. -/
def marks (g : List ℕ) : Finset ℕ :=
  (Finset.range (g.length + 1)).image (fun i => (g.take i).sum)

/-- A ruler is *complete* (a perfect ruler) if its marks form a difference basis for
$\{0, 1, \ldots, L\}$, i.e. every distance $k \le L$ is the difference of two marks. This is
`Finset.IsDifferenceBasis` applied to the marks. -/

(equivalently, fewer segments). -/
def IsMinimal (g : List ℕ) : Prop :=
  IsComplete g ∧ ∀ g' : List ℕ, IsComplete g' → g'.sum = g.sum → g.length ≤ g'.length

(equivalently, the same number of segments) has greater length. -/

/-- **Wichmann's conjecture on optimal rulers.** Every optimal ruler with more than $13$
segments is a Wichmann ruler $W(r, s)$ (up to reflection, i.e. reversing the segment list).
Posed by Wichmann [Wi63]; the finitely many known exceptions all have at most $13$ segments
(lengths $1, 13, 17, 23, 58$), and no further exceptions are known up to length $213$. -/
