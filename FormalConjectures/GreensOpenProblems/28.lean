def IsUniformOnSupport (X : PMF ℤ) : Prop :=
  ∃ (s : Finset ℤ) (hs : s.Nonempty), X = PMF.uniformOfFinset s hs

/--
The discrete convolution of two PMFs on $\mathbb{Z}$, representing the distribution of the sum of
two independent random variables.

noncomputable def indepSum (X Y : PMF ℤ) : PMF ℤ := do
  let x ← X
  let y ← Y
  PMF.pure (x + y)

/--
Suppose that $X, Y$ are two finitely-supported independent random variables taking integer values,
and such that $X + Y$ is uniformly distributed on its range. Are $X$ and $Y$ themselves uniformly
distributed on their ranges?

theorem green_28 : answer(sorry) ↔
  ∀ (X Y : PMF ℤ), -- marginals, independence is built into indepSum
    X.support.Finite ∧ Y.support.Finite ∧ IsUniformOnSupport (indepSum X Y) →
      IsUniformOnSupport X ∧ IsUniformOnSupport Y := by
