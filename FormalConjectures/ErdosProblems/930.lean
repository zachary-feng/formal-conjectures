$n$ is a perfect power if there exist natural numbers $m$ and $l$
such that $1 < l$ and $m^l = n$.

Is it true that, for every $r$, there is a $k$ such that
if $I_1,\ldots,I_r$ are disjoint intervals of consecutive integers,
all of length at least $k$, then
$$
  \prod_{1\leq i\leq r}\prod_{m\in I_i}m
$$
is not a perfect power?

/--
Let $k$, $l$, $n$ be integers such that $k \ge 3$, $l \ge 2$ and $n + k \ge p^{(k)}$,
where $p^{(k)}$ is the least prime satisfying $p^{(k)} \ge k$.
Then there is a prime $p \ge k$ for which $l$ does not divide
the multiplicity of the prime factor $p$ in $(n + 1) \ldots (n + k)$.

/--
Erdos and Selfridge [ErSe75] proved that the product of
consecutive integers is never a power (establishing the case $r=1$).

Theorem 1 from [ErSe75].

It is implied from `erdos_930.variants.consecutive_strong`.
