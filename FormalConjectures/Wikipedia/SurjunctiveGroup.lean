# Gottschalk's surjunctivity conjecture

A group $G$ is *surjunctive* if every injective, continuous, $G$-equivariant map
$A^G \to A^G$ (for any finite alphabet $A$) is surjective.

Here equivariance is with respect to the left shift action of $G$ on $A^G$,
defined by $(g \cdot x)(h) = x(g^{-1} h)$, and continuity is with respect to
the product topology on $A^G$ (where $A$ carries the discrete topology).

Gottschalk's conjecture (1973) states that every group is surjunctive.

/-- The left shift of `x : G → A` by `g : G`, defined by `(shift g x)(h) = x(g⁻¹ * h)`.
This is the standard left shift action of `G` on `A^G`. We define it as a plain function
rather than a `MulAction` instance to avoid conflict with the pointwise `Pi.instMulAction`. -/
