# Ben Green's Open Problem 35

Estimate the infimum of the $L^p$ norm of the self-convolution of a nonnegative integrable
function supported on $[0,1]$ with total integral $1$.

We model a function `f : [0,1] → ℝ≥0` as a function `f : ℝ → ℝ` that is nonnegative, integrable,
supported on `[0,1]`, and has total integral `1`.
