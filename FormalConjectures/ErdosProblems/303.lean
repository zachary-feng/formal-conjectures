Is it true that in any finite colouring of the integers there exists a monochromatic solution
to $\frac 1 a = \frac 1 b + \frac 1 c$ with distinct $a, b, c$?

This is true, as proved by Brown and Rödl [BrRo91].

This was formalized in Lean by Yuan using Seed-Prover.

theorem erdos_303 :
    answer(True) ↔
    -- For any finite colouring of the integers
    ∀ (𝓒 : ℤ → ℤ), (Set.range 𝓒).Finite →
      -- There exists integers `a, b, c`
      ∃ (a b c : ℤ),
      -- that are non-zero and distinct.
      [a, b, c, 0].Nodup ∧
      -- `a, b, c` satisfy the equation
      (1/a : ℝ) = 1/b + 1/c ∧
      -- `a, b, c` have the same color
      (𝓒 '' {a, b, c}).Subsingleton := by
