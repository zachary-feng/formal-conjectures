/-- Does there exists an entire non-zero transcendental function `f : ℂ → ℂ` such that for any
sequence `n₀ < n₁ < ...`, `{ z | ∃ k, iteratedDeriv (n k) f z = 0 }` is dense. -/

theorem erdos_906 : answer(sorry) ↔ ∃ f : ℂ → ℂ, Transcendental (Polynomial ℂ) f ∧
    Differentiable ℂ f ∧ ∀ n : ℕ → ℕ, StrictMono n →
