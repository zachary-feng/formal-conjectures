The number of integers in $\{1,\ldots,N\}$ which are not representable in exactly one way
as the sum of two elements from $A$ (either because they are not representable at all, or
because they are representable in more than one way).

/--
Let $A ⊆ \mathbb{N}$. Let $B ⊆ \mathbb{N}$ be the set of integers which are representable
in exactly one way as the sum of two elements from $A$. Is it true that for all
$\epsilon > 0$ and large $N$, $|\{1,\ldots,N\} \setminus B| \gg_\epsilon N^{1/2 - \epsilon}$?
