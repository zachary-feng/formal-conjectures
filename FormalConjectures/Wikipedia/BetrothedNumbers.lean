/--
Two natural numbers $m$ and $n$ are **betrothed**  (or quasi-amicable) if $\sigma(m) = \sigma(n) = m + n + 1$,
where $\sigma$ is the sum-of-divisors function. Equivalently, the sum of the proper divisors
of $m$ equals $n + 1$, and the sum of the proper divisors of $n$ equals $m + 1$.

**Same parity betrothed numbers conjecture.**
Do there exist betrothed numbers $(m, n)$ where both have the same parity
(both even or both odd)?

All known betrothed pairs consist of one even and one odd number.

Are there infinitely many betrothed number pairs?
