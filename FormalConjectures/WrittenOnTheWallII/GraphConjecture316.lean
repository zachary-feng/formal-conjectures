WOWII [Conjecture 316](http://cms.dt.uh.edu/faculty/delavinae/research/wowII/)

Let `G` be a simple connected graph and let `P` denote the set of pendant vertices
(vertices of degree 1). If `|P| ≥ deg_avg(Gᶜ)`, then `G` is well totally dominated,
where `deg_avg(Gᶜ)` is the average degree of the complement of `G`.
