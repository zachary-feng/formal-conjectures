The property that there exist $a,b\in(n,n+p^c)$ such that $ab\equiv 1\pmod{p}$.

def Erdos445Prop (c : ℝ) (p n : ℕ) : Prop :=
  ∃ a b : ℕ,
    n < a ∧ (a : ℝ) < (n : ℝ) + (p : ℝ) ^ c ∧
    n < b ∧ (b : ℝ) < (n : ℝ) + (p : ℝ) ^ c ∧
    a * b ≡ 1 [MOD p]

/--
Is it true that, for any $c>1/2$, if $p$ is a sufficiently large prime then, for any
$n\geq 0$, there exist $a,b\in(n,n+p^c)$ such that $ab\equiv 1\pmod{p}$?

This is discussed in this MathOverflow question [MathOverflow].

Heilbronn (unpublished) proved this for $c$ sufficiently close to $1$.

Heath-Brown [He00] used Kloosterman sums to prove this for all $c>3/4$.

/-- Small example: for $p=5$, $c=1$, $n=0$, the pair $(2,3) \in (0,5)$ satisfies
$2 \cdot 3 = 6 \equiv 1 \pmod{5}$. -/
