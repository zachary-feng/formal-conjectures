# Agent Guidelines for Formal Conjectures

This document provides guidelines for AI agents working on the Formal Conjectures repository.

## Repository Structure

### Main Directories

- **`FormalConjectures/`**: Contains formalisations of conjectures, organized by source:
  - `ErdosProblems/` - Problems from [erdosproblems.com](https://www.erdosproblems.com/)
  - `Paper/` - Problems from research papers
  - `Arxiv/` - Problems from arXiv papers (organized by arXiv ID)
  - `Books/` - Problems from mathematics books
  - `Wikipedia/` - Problems from Wikipedia
  - `OptimizationConstants/` - Problems from [Tao's Optimization Constants](https://teorth.github.io/optimizationproblems/)
  - Other sources as appropriate

  **IMPORTANT**: Some subdirectories contain their own `README.md` with more specific conventions
  (e.g. naming, docstring, and reference rules). Always check for and follow a subdirectory's
  `README.md` before applying the general guidelines below. For example,
  `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/README.md` defines naming patterns for multi-part questions,
  estimate questions, and variants that supplement the general conventions in this file.

- **`FormalConjectures/Util/`**: Repository infrastructure and utilities:
  - `Attributes/` - Defines the `category` and `AMS` attributes
  - `Answer.lean` - Implements the `answer()` elaborator for problems requiring answers
  - `Linters/` - Custom linters for the repository
  - `ProblemImports.lean` - Standard imports for problem files

- **`FormalConjecturesForMathlib/`**: Definitions, lemmas, and basic API suitable for upstreaming to Mathlib:
  - **IMPORTANT**: No `sorry` is allowed in this directory
  - Follows Mathlib's directory structure (e.g., `Topology/`, `Algebra/`, `NumberTheory/`)
  - Contains supporting definitions and lemmas needed for problem statements
  - Code here should be of Mathlib quality and eventually PR-able to Mathlib

## Formalisation Conventions

### Namespaces

Each problem file should define its content in a dedicated namespace:

```lean
namespace Erdos10

-- definitions, theorems, variants here

end Erdos10
```

For variants of a problem, use dotted notation within the same namespace:

```lean
theorem main_conjecture : ... := by
  sorry

theorem main_conjecture.variants.special_case : ... := by
  sorry
```

### The `category` Attribute

Every theorem/lemma should have exactly one `category` attribute indicating its type:

**Values:**

- `@[category textbook]` - Textbook level math problem (high school, undergraduate, or graduate)
- `@[category research open]` - Open research problem (no accepted solution exists)
- `@[category research solved]` - Solved research problem (informal proof widely accepted)
- `@[category test]` - Sanity check or unit test for definitions
- `@[category API]` - Basic theory around a new definition

**Examples:**

```lean
@[category research open, AMS 11]
theorem riemann_hypothesis : ... := by
  sorry

@[category test, AMS 11]
theorem sanity_check : ¬ SomeBadProperty := by
  sorry

@[category API]
lemma basic_property_of_new_definition : ... := by exact ...
```

### The `formal_proof` Attribute

The `formal_proof` attribute records the existence and location of a formal proof.
It is independent of the `category` attribute and can be used with any category.

**Values:**

- `@[formal_proof using formal_conjectures at "link"]` - Formally proved in this repository
- `@[formal_proof using lean4 at "link"]` - Formally proved in Lean 4 elsewhere
- `@[formal_proof using other_system at "link"]` - Formally proved in another system
  (Roqc, Isabelle, Lean 3, HOL, etc.)

**Examples:**

```lean
@[category research solved, AMS 11, formal_proof using lean4 at "https://github.com/example"]
theorem some_solved_problem : ... := by
  sorry

@[category textbook, AMS 11, formal_proof using formal_conjectures at "https://..."]
theorem a_textbook_problem_with_proof : ... := by
  sorry
```

**Note:** A `formal_proof` annotation on a `research open` problem will trigger a lint warning,
since open problems should not have proofs.

### The `AMS` Attribute

Every problem should have at least one AMS subject classification number from the [AMS MSC2020](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/pdfs/classifications2020.pdf).

**Common subjects:**

- `3` - Mathematical logic and foundations
- `5` - Combinatorics
- `11` - Number theory
- `14` - Algebraic geometry
- `54` - General topology
- `60` - Probability theory

Multiple subjects can be specified:

```lean
@[AMS 5 11]  -- Both combinatorics and number theory
theorem erdos_problem : ... := by
  sorry
```

**In VS Code:** Use `#AMS` command to list all available subjects and their numbers. Hover over a number to see its description.

### The `answer()` Elaborator

For problems that ask questions requiring specific answers (not just yes/no), use `answer(sorry)`:

```lean
/-- Does $P$ hold? -/
@[category research open]
theorem problem_name : answer(sorry) ↔ SomeProperty := by
  sorry
```

Note that if the statement of the theorem depends on some variables, then the quantification should
happen _after_ the `answer(sorry)`, i.e.

```lean
/-- Does $P(n)$ hold for all $n$? -/
@[category research open]
theorem problem_name : answer(sorry) ↔ ∀ n, P n := by
  sorry
```

rather than

```lean
/-- Does $P(n)$ hold for all $n$? -/
@[category research open]
theorem problem_name (n) : answer(sorry) ↔ P n := by
  sorry
```

When the problem is solved:

- Replace `answer(sorry)` with `answer(True)` or `answer(False)` as appropriate
- Update the category to `research solved`
- If a formal proof exists, add `formal_proof using <kind> at "<link>"`

**Note:** Providing a term inside `answer()` does NOT automatically mean the problem is mathematically solved - trivial or tautological answers don't count as solutions.

### File Organization

1. **One problem per file** (with flexibility for closely related variants)
2. **Copyright header required** (see template in README.md, use year 2026)
3. **Module docstring** with references:

   ```lean
   /-!
   # Problem Name

   *References:*
   - [Title](URL) by *Author Name*, Journal (Year)
   - [Title](URL)

   Brief description if needed.
   -/
   ```

   For a single reference, `*Reference:*` (singular) is also acceptable.

4. **Import structure**:
   - Problem files: Import `FormalConjectures.Util.ProblemImports`
   - ForMathlib files: Import only necessary Mathlib modules
5. If a problem fits in several directories then it should stated in one directory rather than copied
   accross several. In other directories, one can simply add a file with a declaration pointing
   to the original, e.g.

   ```lean
   @[category research open, AMS 11]
   theorem pointer_to_original : type_of% my_original_theorem := by
     sorry
   ```

   See for example `FormalConjectures/GreensOpenProblems/81.lean`.

### Variants and Related Results

Variants should be in the same file as the main conjecture:

```lean
@[category research open, AMS 11]
theorem main_conjecture : MainStatement := by
  sorry

@[category research solved, AMS 11]
theorem main_conjecture.variants.weaker_version : WeakerStatement := by
  sorry

@[category test, AMS 11]
theorem main_conjecture.variants.small_cases : MainStatement with (n < 100) := by
  interval_cases n <;> decide
```

## Lean and Mathlib Style Guidelines

### Naming Conventions

Follow [Mathlib's naming conventions](https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/naming.html). Unlike Lean 3, Lean 4 uses a combination of `snake_case`, `lowerCamelCase`, and `UpperCamelCase`:

#### Capitalization Rules

1. **Terms of Props** (proofs, theorem names) use `snake_case`:

   ```lean
   theorem fermat_last_theorem : FermatLastTheorem := by sorry
   lemma add_comm (a b : ℕ) : a + b = b + a := by sorry
   ```

2. **Props and Types** (inductive types, structures, classes) use `UpperCamelCase`:

   ```lean
   class HasGδSingletons (X : Type*) [TopologicalSpace X] : Prop
   structure MyStructure where
     field1 : ℕ
     field2 : String
   inductive Color where
     | Red | Green | Blue
   ```

3. **Functions** are named the same way as their return values:
   - A function `A → B → C` is named as though it's a term of type `C`.
   - A function `A → B → Prop` or `A → B → Type _` should be named in `UpperCamelCase`.
   - A function `A → B → C` where `C : Type _` and `C` isn't itself `Type _` should be named in
    `lowerCamelCase`.
   - A function `A → B → C` where `C : Prop` should be named in `snake_case`.

4. **All other terms of Types** use `lowerCamelCase`:

   ```lean
   def leftFactorial (n : ℕ) : ℕ := ∑ i in Finset.range n, i!
   def myFunction (x : ℕ) : ℕ := x + 1
   ```

5. **UpperCamelCase in snake_case contexts**: When something named with `UpperCamelCase` is part of something named with `snake_case`, it is referenced in `lowerCamelCase`:

   ```lean
   theorem fermat_last_theorem : FermatLastTheorem := by sorry
   theorem nat_factorial_pos (n : ℕ) : 0 < n! := by sorry
   ```

6. **Acronyms**: Written as a group in upper-/lowercase depending on the first character:
   - `LE`, `LT`, `GE`, `GT` (when in `UpperCamelCase` context)
   - `le`, `lt`, `ge`, `gt` (when in `lowerCamelCase` context)

7. **Structure fields and constructors**: Follow the same rules (1-6) as top-level declarations

#### Common Naming Patterns

- `add_comm`, `mul_assoc` - operation + property
- `Nat.factorial_pos` - namespace + definition + property
- `foo_of_bar` - derive `foo` from hypothesis `bar`
- `bar_iff_foo` - equivalence between `bar` and `foo`
- `foo_le_bar` - inequality statement

#### Exceptions

Some rare exceptions exist for consistency:

- `Ne` (not `NE`) follows `Eq`
- Intervals: `Set.Icc`, `Set.Iic` (capital `I` despite convention)
- Some legacy structure fields may be lowercase

**Note**: In this repository, most declarations are theorems (terms of Props), so you'll primarily use `snake_case`.

### Code Quality

- **Use Unicode math symbols** where appropriate: `∀`, `∃`, `∈`, `⊆`, `∧`, `∨`, `¬`, etc.
- **Format code properly**: Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- **Add docstrings** with the math written in LaTeX for definitions and main theorems. Note that docstrings should generally use LaTeX markdown (e.g., `$P$` instead of `` `P` ``) to represent mathematical expressions, except for the `FormalConjecturesForMathlib` parts and for definitions that are very much on the Lean/Mathlib API side, where backticks are preferred:

  ```lean
  /--
  The left factorial of $n$, defined as $0! + 1! + 2! + ... + (n-1)!$
  -/
  def left_factorial (n : ℕ) := ...
  ```

- **`research open`, `research solved` and `textbook` docstrings MUST include** a concise description of the
  problem:

  ```lean
  /--
  Can every even integer greater than 2 be written as the sum of two primes?
  -/
  @[category research open, AMS 11]
  theorem goldbach :
      answer(sorry) ↔ ∀ n : ℕ, 2 < n → Even n → ∃ p q, Prime p ∧ Prime q ∧ n = p + q := by
    sorry
  ```

- **Use `local notation`** for problem-specific notation within namespaces
- **Avoid unnecessary type annotations** when Lean can infer them
- **Use `by` tactic mode** for sorries: `by sorry` (not just `sorry`)
- **Do not try to add a suggested informal proof for an open research problem**
- **Avoid using tactics like `native_decide` in proofs**. These are completely banned in `FormalConjecturesForMathlib`
  and may be considered on a case by case basis for in `category test` statements in problem files
  when the goal is a large computation.

### Imports

- Be specific with imports - don't import more than needed
- In FormalConjecturesForMathlib, import only from Mathlib
- In problem files, import only `FormalConjectures.Util.ProblemImports`, unless you are adding a
  pointer to another problem or need to state an implication.

## Agent-Specific Requirements

### Before Submitting

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**

1. **`lake --wfail build` MUST pass** without errors before submitting for review
   - Run `lake --wfail build` in the repository root
   - Fix all compilation errors
   - Fix all linter warnings (fail for warning option is set by `--wfail`)
   - Ensure all dependencies are properly imported

2. **`sorry` usage restrictions**:
   - ✅ **ALLOWED**: In `FormalConjectures/` for benchmark problem statements

     ```lean
     @[category research open]
     theorem open_conjecture : Statement := by sorry
     ```

   - ❌ **NOT ALLOWED**: In `FormalConjecturesForMathlib/`

     ```lean
     -- WRONG - will be rejected
     def helper_function : Type := sorry
     lemma helper_lemma : P := by sorry
     ```

   - Exception: `answer(sorry)` is allowed as a placeholder for unknown answers

3. **Completeness**:
   - No placeholder definitions (e.g., `def foo : Type := sorry`)
   - No incomplete type annotations or holes
   - All referenced definitions must exist
   - All imports must be correct

4. **Clean code**:
   - Remove commented-out code
   - Remove debug statements
   - No unused imports
   - No unnecessary intermediate definitions

### Quality Checklist

Before considering your work complete, verify:

- [ ] File has correct copyright header (current year)
- [ ] Module docstring with reference links present
- [ ] Namespace properly opened and closed
- [ ] All theorems have `category` attribute
- [ ] All theorems have at least one `AMS` subject
- [ ] Names follow snake_case convention
- [ ] `lake build` succeeds
- [ ] No `sorry` in FormalConjecturesForMathlib/
- [ ] Docstrings present for main definitions
- [ ] `research open`, `textbook` and `research solved` docstrings include a concise description
- [ ] Code properly formatted and readable

### Testing Definitions

When adding new definitions to FormalConjecturesForMathlib/, include basic sanity checks:

```lean
-- In FormalConjecturesForMathlib/Topology/MyDefinition.lean
class MyNewClass (X : Type*) : Prop where
  property : SomeProperty X

-- In FormalConjectures/Paper/ProblemUsingMyDefinition.lean
@[category test]
theorem myNewClass_sanity_check :
    MyNewClass SomeConcreteType := by
  constructor
  exact proof_of_property
```

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **DON'T:**

- Use `sorry` outside of problem statement proofs
- Create files without copyright headers
- Forget to add `category` and `AMS` attributes
- Submit code that doesn't compile
- Add large proofs (this is a benchmark repository, not a proof repository)
- Use camelCase for theorem names
- Create placeholder definitions in FormalConjecturesForMathlib/

✅ **DO:**

- Follow existing file patterns in the repository
- Keep formalisations clean and minimal
- Add references to sources. These should all appear in the module docstring reference list, and
  each `textbook`, `research open` and `research solved` theorem docstring MUST have a reference and a
  concise description of the problem.
- Use namespaces appropriately
- Test that `lake build` works
- Add variants in the same file as the main problem
- Include basic API for new definitions
