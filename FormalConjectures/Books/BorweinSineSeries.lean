Does the series
$$
  \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\left(\frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{3}\sin n\right)^n}{n}
$$
converge?

After computing approximately $10^7$ terms, the partial sums approximate $2.163$.

See https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11017 for a proof of the convergence,
relying on an irrationality measure for pi.

Also see
https://github.com/AxiomMath/gdm-formal-conjectures/blob/main/docs/BorweinSineSeries.md
for a partial formalization of the conjecture,
conditional on such an irrationality measure of pi (cf https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06345).
