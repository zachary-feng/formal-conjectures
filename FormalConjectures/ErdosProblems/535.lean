All elements of `A` are positive and have exactly `k` prime factors,
counted with multiplicity.

Erdős [Er73] explains that Abbott pointed out the ordinary sunflower conjecture
does not seem to suffice for Problem 535; the corrected stronger auxiliary
statement uses $Ω$, not $ω$.

/--
Let $r \geq 3$, and let $f_r(N)$ denote the size of the largest subset of $\{1,\ldots,N\}$
such that no subset of size $r$ has the same pairwise greatest common divisor between all
elements. Erdős [Er64] proved that $f_3(N) > N^{c/\log\log N}$ for some constant $c > 0$, and
conjectured this should also be an upper bound; here we state the conjectural upper bound
for all $r \geq 3$.

The first open case of Erdős Problem 535 is $r = 3$: there should exist $c > 0$ such that
$f_3(N) \leq N^{c/\log\log N}$ for all sufficiently large $N$.

/--
Erdős [Er73] records that Abbott pointed out the ordinary sunflower conjecture
does not seem to suffice here. The stronger auxiliary conjecture uses $Ω(n)=k$,
i.e. prime factors counted with multiplicity; this stronger statement would imply
the conjectured upper bound for $f_r(N)$.

For the stronger $Ω(n)=k$ variant above, the Erdős–Rado method gives the weaker
bound $c_r^k \cdot k!$; see Erdős [Er73].
