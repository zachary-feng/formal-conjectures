# Kotzig's Conjecture

*Reference:* A. Kotzig, cited in A. Rosa, *On certain valuations of the vertices of a graph*,
Theory of Graphs (Internat. Sympos., Rome, 1966), Gordon and Breach, 1967, pp. 349–355.

Kotzig conjectured that for every $n$, the complete graph $K_{2n+1}$ decomposes into copies of
any $n$-edge tree via cyclic shifts of a single embedding. This is strictly stronger than
Ringel's conjecture; see `Paper/RingelConjecture.lean`. The large-$n$ case is proved by
Montgomery–Pokrovskiy–Sudakov; see `Arxiv/2001.02665/RingelConjecture.lean`.

For any tree $T$ with $n$ edges, the complete graph $K_{2n+1}$ decomposes into
$2n+1$ edge-disjoint copies of $T$ via cyclic shifts of a single embedding.

The $2n+1$ copies are $f_0, f_1, \dots, f_{2n}$ where $f_i(v) = f_0(v) + i$ for all vertices
$v$ — each copy is obtained by adding $i \pmod{2n+1}$ to every vertex of the base copy.
This is strictly stronger than `RingelConjecture.ringel_conjecture`.
