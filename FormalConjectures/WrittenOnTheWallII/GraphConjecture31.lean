# Written on the Wall II - Conjecture 31

The WOWII page records this as **Chung's theorem**: proved in F. R. K. Chung,
*The average distance and the independence number*, J. Graph Theory **12** (1988),
229-235. We state it here as a theorem; the formal proof is left as `sorry`
pending a Lean port of Chung's argument.

Here $\mathrm{path}(G)$ is the floor of the average distance over ordered pairs
of distinct vertices (definition `path` in `FormalConjecturesForMathlib`), and
$\mathrm{rad}(G)$ is the graph radius.

WOWII [Conjecture 31](http://cms.uhd.edu/faculty/delavinae/research/wowII/all.html#conj31)
(Chung 1988):

For every simple connected graph $G$,
$\mathrm{path}(G) \ge 2 \cdot \mathrm{rad}(G) - 1$,
where $\mathrm{path}(G)$ is the floor of the average distance and
$\mathrm{rad}(G)$ is the graph radius.
